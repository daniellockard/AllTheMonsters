Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground._  \n**Paradoxical Predators.** Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas.
