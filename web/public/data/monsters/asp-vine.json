If the target is a creature it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends the target is restrained and must succeed on a new save each round it remains grappled or take another 5 (2d4) poison. The asp vine can grapple up to four targets at a time though it can still make vine attacks vs. other targets even if it has four grappled opponents."
