Though they idly devour their victims, they have enough awareness of potential retribution to keep a few corpses available to quickly heal themselves.  \n**Connected to Bonerot.** Pustulent shamblers have a preternatural link to the disease they inflict. This allows them to track escaping victims and be present when the disease overtakes their prey.  \n**Ooze Nature.** The pustulent shambler doesn’t require sleep.",
