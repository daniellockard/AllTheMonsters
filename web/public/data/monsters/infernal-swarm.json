  "desc": "A towering winged devil looms above, a wicked scimitar in its grasp. Its form shifts subtly, hinting at a deeper secret._  \n**Infernal Insects.** Infernal swarms are found throughout the Hells. Considered a delicacy, these insects can form a hive mind, which they use to shape their swarm into a massive winged devil whenever they are threatened. The individual insects are bat-winged and have bulging eyes, long spindly legs, and a carapace covered in poisonous barbs.  \n**Hellish Poison.** Infernal swarms feed on carrion, injecting the carcasses with a poison that liquifies tissue. This same poison coats their barbs, which painfully dissuades predators.  \n**Sensitive to Sound.** Loud noises disorient the insects and interrupt their coordination, temporarily scattering the individuals. However, it is rare to encounter these silent killers hunting on their own, and if one is spotted, there are certain to be many more to follow.",

A creature within 10 feet of the swarm immediately discerns the truth.\n\nWhile in fiend form, it can wield weapons and hold, grasp, push, pull, or interact with objects that might otherwise require a more humanoid form to accomplish. If the infernal swarm takes thunder damage while in its fiend form, it immediately changes to its shapeless form.\n\nWhile in shapeless form, it can occupy another creature's space and vice versa and can move through any opening large enough for a Small fiend, but it can't grapple or be grappled."
