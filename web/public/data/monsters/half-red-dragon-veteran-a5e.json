A creature who fails the saving throw also suffers 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. At the end of each of its turns  it can repeat the saving throw  ending the ongoing damage on a success. This fire can also be put out in typical ways  such as immersion in water  and a creature who uses an action to drop prone can put out the fire with a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw."
