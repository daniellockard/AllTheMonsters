  "desc": "This tall, emaciated giant has unnaturally long arms ending in razor-sharp talons. It has a strangely conical head with glowing red eyes and fearsome fangs. Its skin is a dark gray-green, and its body is completely devoid of hair._  \n**Giant Bogeymen.** Lurking in abandoned mansions, dark wells, ancient mine shafts, and similar locations, thin giants are one of the most sinister and frightening of all giant species. The villains of many children’s nightmares, thin giants are feared even by other giants, as their life-draining bite and ability to get into tight spaces make them unsettling at best and horrifying at worst. Thin giants don’t get along with most creatures, but they have been observed leading groups of ghouls, ettercaps, and trolls to capture and devour prey.  \n**Contortion Experts.** Thin giants have remarkable control over their bodies. They can twist their limbs into unnatural positions and even bend completely double. The flexibility and elasticity help the giants shrug off crushing blows. They can stay in contorted positions for extraordinary lengths of time and use this to their advantage to ambush unsuspecting creatures.",
