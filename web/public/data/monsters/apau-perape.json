Its long, muscular arms stretch to the ground, ending in wickedly curved claws._  \n_**Servants of Fire.**_ These black-furred gorilla demons serve only their demon lord. Their final loyalty is unshakable, though sometimes they serve others for a time— and they have no fear of fire, gleefully setting fire to villages and crops if their master is snubbed or insulted.  \n_**Fearless Attackers.**_ The apau perape are fearless and savage, living for battle. Once in combat, their morale never breaks. Like their master, they have an insatiable hunger and do not leave any dead behind, consuming even their bones.  \n_**Eyes of Fire.**_ When this demon is angered, its eyes glow a deep, disturbing red, unlike any natural ape.",
