Each creature within 15 feet that can hear the howl must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) cold damage and is frightened for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't frightened. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more also suffers one level of exhaustion. A frightened creature can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
