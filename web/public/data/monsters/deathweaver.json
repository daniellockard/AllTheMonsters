Their carapaces are mottled patterns of black, crimson, and ivory, and two arms flank their fangs.  \n**Allied Evil.** Deathweavers are often found in league with other intelligent, evil creatures. A powerful necromancer or an evil cult might ally with one, using the undead it spawns to bolster their strength in exchange for treasure or favors.  \n**Web Spawn.** The deathweaverâ€™s webs infuse corpses left in them with necrotic energy. A humanoid corpse cocooned in the webbing for 24 hours has a 50 percent chance of rising as a Open Game License",
