  "desc": "Firetamers are the elite elementalists of the fire elemental wardens, using their attunement to the primordial forces of the world to not just create fire, not just command it, but tame it to their will. A firetamer is nothing like the manic pyromancers; while the latter recklessly wields fire as a weapon, firetamers use their talent to protect others from fire’s destructive power—or to use that same power to destroy those who threaten their people. Firetamers are almost always accompanied by a salamander, a fire elemental, or a small herd of magma or smoke mephits.",
