  "desc": "_These scaly creatures resemble nothing so much as tiny, batwinged dragonkin._  \n**Dragon Sprites.** Chernomoi (which means “lair sprite” in Draconic) often reside discreetly in a dragon lair or dragonborn household, cleaning and tidying up at night, and only occasionally keeping a small trinket or shiny gemstone as compensation. They appear as tiny, winged dragonkin, dressed in metallic armor made of small coins and semi-precious stones.  \n**Lair Alarms.** Chernomoi are terrified of wyverns and never lair anywhere near them. Otherwise, they are very protective of their draconic masters and raise an alarm if an intruder is undetected. They fight with their tiny blades and Shriek attack if cornered, though they always flee from danger as a first option— usually straight to a dragon, dragonborn, or drake ally.",
