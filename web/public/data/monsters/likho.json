  "desc": "_Malformed like a goblin, this creature bears one large, strange eye in the middle of its face. It wears dark and dirty rags, and its spindly claws and arms match its hunched torso._  \n**Ferocious Attitude.** Likho are scrappy fighters; they weaken foes from afar with their magical attacks to curse and enfeeble enemies, then rush forward in a blazing charge and jump onto their foes, shredding them with their claws. Once a likho has leapt onto a creature, it shreds flesh using the claws on both its hands and feet.  \n**Jeers and Insults.** A likho uses its message spells to taunt and jeer its target from a distance during the hunt. In addition, to flinging curses and ill luck, likho frustrate and infuriate their enemies because they are difficult to hit. A likho enjoys stalking intelligent humanoids and tormenting them from hiding until discovered or when it grows tired of the hunt.  \n**Organ Eaters.** Likho thrive when they drain away luck and aptitude. Once the likho immobilizes a creature, it gnaws at the creature’s abdomen with its jagged teeth, devouring the organs of its still-living prey. A likho consumes only a humanoid’s organs and leaves the rest of the carcass behind.",
