Their devices and armor are incomprehensible to—possibly even incompatible with— creatures of this reality.  \n**Tamper with Fate.** The xhkarsh utilize their fate-altering powers to distort personal histories and manipulate mortal destinies like puppeteers. By doing this, they realign the universe toward their own, esoteric ends—but what those ends might be, only the xhkarsh know.  \n**Foes of Skein Witches.** Skein witches and valkyries are perpetual enemies of the xhkarsh, whom they accuse of perverting the proper run of destiny for both great heroes and ordinary folk.",

This effect lasts until the xhkarsh ends it or the target's fate is restored by a dispel evil and good spell or comparable magic.
