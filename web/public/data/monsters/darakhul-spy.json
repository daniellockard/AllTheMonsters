Some of the best spies have spent decades hiding in plain sight in courts, taverns, and slums across the world.  \n**Complex Network.** Each spy has one superior to whom it reports, and each superior spy has a separate superior spy to whom it reports. Only the highest leaders have knowledge of the intricacies of the spy network, and even they aren’t fully aware of the true identities of their furthest-reaching agents.  \n_**Hungry Dead Nature.**_ The darakhul doesn’t require air or sleep.",
