  "desc": "_Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand and a warhammer in the other. Itâ€™s a solid slab of muscle that towers imposingly over most humans._  \nThe hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp teeth. Dark fur covers their bodies, which are packed with muscle. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 600 pounds.  \n**Passionate and Volatile.** Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk are a people of extremes. They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger. Settling differences with wrestling matches that leave permanent scars is common, as is seeing two bloodied bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and a raucous song after such a scuffle.",
