  "desc": "_This grinning humanoid looks like a handsome man, though his skin is black as obsidian, his eye glow red, and he has both insectoid legs and antennae._  \n**Dark Satyrs.** The selang or dark satyrs are twisted and vicious fauns who have abandoned nature worship, and instead venerate ancient gods of deep and malign intelligence. Selangs seek to help those evil gods enter the mortal world by opening dark portals and bridging a path to realms beyond mortal understanding.  \n**Battle Song and Laughter.** Selangs relish battle, pain, and tortureâ€”they find violence thrilling and bloodshed exciting, and they often laugh, sing, and boast shamelessly during combat. Although they are the diplomats and spokesmen of the old gods, their manic speech and alien logic can be hard to follow, requiring an Intelligence check (DC 16) to understand a dark satyr each round. They are most comfortable with the slithering tones of the Void Speech.  \n**Blasphemous Music.** Their cults and settlements are often found at the sites sacred to the dark gods, making hypnotic and alien harmonies with swarms of dorreqi. They are rarely the strongest soldiers, instead encouraging evil humanoids or other creatures of martial mien to fill the ranks, while the dark satyrs use their magic and poison against their foes.",

A creature that saves successfully against this psychic effect is immune to the piping for 24 hours. The selang can use each of these spell-like effects once per day."
