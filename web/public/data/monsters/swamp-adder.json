  "desc": "_A vicious snake with a squat, diamond-shaped head, a puffed neck, and a peculiar yellow band around its body, the swamp adder is a stout, somewhat lethargic hunter._  \n_**Marsh Hunter.**_ This venomous snake—sometimes known as the “speckled band”—is native to the marshes of southern realms, where it devours waterfowl and incautious halflings.  \n_**Bred for Venom.**_ The swamp adder is simultaneously feared and prized for its potent paralytic venom. A swamp adder is quite thin, though it may grow up to 12 feet long and the largest weigh as much as 50 pounds. A dose of paralytic swamp adder venom is worth 3,000 gp or more on the black market.",
