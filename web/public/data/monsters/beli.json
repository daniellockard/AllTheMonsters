  "desc": "_These small, winter faeries are vicious and deadly. With their pale skin and translucent wings, they blend perfectly into their snowy environment; only their beady black eyes stand out against the snow and ice._  \nThese malevolent ice-sprites are a plague upon the people of snowy climates, ambushing unwary prey with icy arrows and freezing spell-like powers.  \n**Servants of the North Wind.** Known as “patzinaki” in some dialects of Dwarvish, the beli are the servants of winter gods and venerate the north wind as Boreas and other gods of darker aspects. They are frequent allies with the fraughashar.  \n**Feast Crashers.** Beli especially delight in disrupting feasts and making off with the holiday cakes—the least deadly of their malicious pranks.  \n**Fear of Druids.** They have an irrational fear of northern druids and their snow bear companions.",
