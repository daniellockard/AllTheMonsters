  "desc": "_This obese, bell-shaped giant is blemished by ulcers, enlarged veins, and fungal rashes. Though it stumbles about on a pair of short, calloused legs, it moves its weight with dangerous potential, catching many foes off-guard._  \n**Great Girth.** Whether as a result of a centuriespast curse or a gradual adaptation to an easy-going existence, the flab giant (one of the shortest breeds of giant) is gigantic in width rather than height and almost comical in its simple life.  \nToo obese to effectively grasp weapons in its chubby fingers, a flab giant uses its great mass to deadly effect, overrunning or grabbing opponents and then sitting on them to crush them to death, swatting away missiles, and simply putting up with the damage of melee attacks until its victims stop struggling and it gets up to see if they’re dead yet.  \n**Efficient Foragers.** Flab giants are the least active of giant types, spending most of their waking hours resting, napping, and sleeping, and only devote a short period each day to listlessly shuffling about, scrounging for food. Because a flab giant can eat practically anything, it doesn’t have to roam far to find enough food to sustain its bulk, so it is rarely found far from its crude lair.  \n**Knotted Skins.** Flab giants wear only scraps of clothing made of loosely knotted skins, leaving most of their stretch-marked and discolored skin exposed. Favored pelts include bear and human. A flab giant stands eight to ten feet tall and weighs 1,000 to 1,500 pounds.",
