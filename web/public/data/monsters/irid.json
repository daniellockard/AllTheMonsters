These small manifestations of rainbows bear similarities in appearance and mission to their elevated cousins, but they take little interest in angelic ideals.  \n**Mischievous Messengers.** While angels are known for bringing messages and truth to mortals from the gods, irids prefer to bring gossip and embellished truths. They follow their own ideals of beauty and excitement, disregarding their angelic cousinsâ€™ insistence on goodness and truth. Irids delight in sneaking around, listening for gossip or revealed secrets, then invisibly whispering exaggerations of in the ears of those who will help spread such gossip.  \n**Colorful and Shallow.** Irids are iridescent, changing the color of the light they shed throughout the day. They are drawn to the brightest colors the world has to offer. To them, evil is synonymous with ugliness, and they resist fighting or hurting anything they find beautiful.",
