  "desc": "_This ill-tempered, six-horned creature resembles a triceratops the size of an ox, with pairs of horns atop its nose and brows, as well as great tusks jutting from each side of its mouth._  \n_**Hatred of Elephants.**_ Ngobous are ox-sized dinosaurs often at war with elephants over territory. Ngobous are irascible and suspicious by nature, prone to chasing after any creature that stays too long inside its territory. They also become aggressive when they can see or smell elephants. Even old traces of elephants’ scent are sufficient to trigger an ngobou’s rage.  \n_**Poor Beasts of War.**_ Grasslands tribes sometimes try to train ngobous as beasts of burden or war, but most have given up on the ill-tempered animals; their behavior is too erratic, especially if elephants are nearby or have been in the area recently.  \n_**Trample Crops.**_ Ngobou herds can smash entire crops flat in minutes—and their horns can tear through a herd of goats or cattle in little time as well.",
