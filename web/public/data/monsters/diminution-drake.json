  "desc": "The diminution drake removes its stinger from its prey, watching them shrink to one-foot-tall. It then flings its spaghetti-like tongue around the pint-sized victim and engulfs it in one swift motion._  \nThis draconic hunter can shrink or grow from a cat-sized to a person-sized drake. Diminution drakes resemble dragons with a long, tubular snouts. Their eyes have red pupils that continually contract from wide spheres to tiny dots and back again. They have subpar vision and hearing but an extraordinary sense of smell.  \n**Shrinking Hunter.** The diminution drake uses the shrinking properties of its toxic breath weapon and stinger to reduce the size of its prey. Once a creature has been reduced in size, the drake uses its spaghetti-like tongue to swallow its prey.  \n**Hunters of Sport.** Diminution drakes can live off of rodents and small animals, but they find great satisfaction in hunting, diminishing, and devouring larger prey. The gut of the drake can digest anything, and digesting a shrunken, armored adventurer is of no consequence. The drake is a cunning hunter, often hiding as a tiny creature to set up ambushes.",
