  "desc": "_A motionless rust drake is easily mistaken for a pile of scrap metal._  \n**Shedding Rust.** Aside from fangs and claws like iron spikes, this dragon-like creature seems to be nothing more than a collection of rust. Each beating of its wings brings a shower of flakes.  \n**Warped Metallics.** Many sages claim that rust dragons are a perversion of nature’s order obtained either by the corruption of a metallic dragon’s egg or the transformation of such a dragon by way of a ritual. Others disagree and propose another theory about a malady that affects the skin of young metallic dragons and ferrous drakes alike. So far, no one has discovered the truth about their origins.  \n**Filthy Scrap Metal Eaters.** These foul creatures feed on rust and are known as disease carriers.",

If it fails, the victim takes 1d3 Dexterity damage and is paralyzed for 24 hours; if the saving throw succeeds, the creature takes no damage and feels well enough to act normally for the day. This continues until the creature dies from Dexterity loss, recovers naturally by making successful saving throws after two consecutive long rests, or is cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic. After the disease ends, the victim recovers 1d3 lost Dexterity with each long rest; greater restoration or comparable magic can restore it all at once."
