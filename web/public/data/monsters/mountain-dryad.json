Their beauty is more rugged, with hair the color of lichen and skin the shade of their mountainâ€™s stone.  \n**Despise Mining.** Mountain dryads tend to spend long stretches of time sleeping deep within their mountains, and they do not take kindly to the scarring of their homes. The dryads have a particular dislike for dwarves, kobolds, and others who make their living mining mountains.",

Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the dryad must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 minute. A charmed creature is incapacitated and, if it is more than 5 feet away from the mountain dryad, it must move on its turn toward the dryad by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the dryad, it can repeat the saving throw. While charmed within 5 feet of the dryad, a Medium or smaller creature must climb the dryad, no check required. After climbing 20 feet, the charmed creature throws itself off the mountain dryad, taking falling damage and landing prone in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the mountain dryad. A charmed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
