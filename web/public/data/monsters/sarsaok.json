  "desc": "This huge, six-horned, bull-like creature possesses a mane of writhing flames and shimmering metal skin._  \n**Creation of the Gods.** All sarsaok descend from a mighty celestial ox said to have been present at the creation of humanity. Scholars speculate the union of domestic or wild oxen produced the first sarsaok.  \n**Inhospitable Habitats.** The sarsaok dwell in areas of great heat and fire such as Volcanoes or other geologically active regions. In addition to consuming flora, they are known to drink liquid magma and graze on obsidian, pumice, or other volcanic rock.  \n**Peaceful Horror.** Though of great size and strength, sarsaoks are peaceful herbivores similar in demeanor to wild oxen. When threatened, an entire herd attacks until the threat has ended.",
