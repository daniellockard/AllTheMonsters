  "desc": "_A gnarljak looks like a bear trap springs sprung to clacking life and ready to tear flesh apart._  \n**Hopping Motion.** All steel and springs, a gnarljak is easily mistaken for a simple bear trap when lying dormant. But once it starts hopping in pursuit of a target, it reveals its animated nature and its only motivation: destruction of living things.  \n**Endless Snapping.** Gnarljaks are mindless. They do not grow tired. They exist only to pull creatures to the ground and chew through them, then turn around and chew through them again.  \n**Defensive Traps.** Some try to use gnarljaks to guard treasures or booby-trap approaches to important locations, but their indiscriminate biting makes quite dangerous to their owners as well. Certain monsters such as redcaps and shadow fey use gnarljakâ€™s with some regularity, and gnomes are very fond of making them part of a standard tunnel defense.",
