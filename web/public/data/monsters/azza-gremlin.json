Arcs of lightning snap between their long ears._  \n**Lightning Lovers.** Azza gremlins live among storm clouds, lightning-based machinery, and other places with an abundance of lightning.  \n**Magnetic Flight.** Although wingless, their light bodies are perfectly attuned to electromagnetic fields, giving them buoyancy and flight. They love playing in thunderstorms and riding lightning bolts between the clouds or between clouds and the ground. They feed off lightning and love to see its effects on other creatures.  \n**Work with Spellcasters.** Although they arenâ€™t much more than hazardous pests by themselves, more malicious creatures and spellcasters that use lightning as a weapon work with azza gremlins to amplify their own destructiveness.  \nAzza gremlins stand 12 to 18 inches tall and weigh approximately 8 lb.",
