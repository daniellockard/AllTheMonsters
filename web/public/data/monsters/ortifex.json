  "desc": "A large, rotting heart floats forward, its hypnotic heartbeat echoing all around it._  \n**Vampiric Hunters.** An ortifex’s singular purpose is to absorb blood from living creatures. When seeking blood, it disorients victims with an ominous, hypnotic heartbeat, then magically siphons their blood, leaving behind a shriveled carcass.  \n**Harvested from Giants and Dragons.** Only large hearts can be made into ortifexes, which are typically created from the hearts of giants, dragons, and particularly large beasts. Necromancers who create ortifexes for vampiric clients pay well for a sizeable heart, especially if it is minimally decomposed.  \n**Agents of Oppression.** When a blood cult, necromancer, or intelligent undead wants to demoralize a village or demand a sacrifice, it often sends an ortifex to collect payment in blood.  \n**Undead Nature.** An ortifex doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.\n\nUnless surprised, a creature can plug its ears to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn.
