  "desc": "_This raging cloud of animate mist and ice has icicle shards for eyes and claws. In battle or when hunting, a thuellai howls like a dozen screaming banshees._  \n_**Servants of Boreas.**_ These fast-flying creatures of air and ice were created by the lord of the north wind, Boreas, to be his heralds, assassins, and hunting hounds. They appear as a swirling blizzard, often blending in with snowstorms to surprise their victims.  \n_**Terrifying Blizzards.**_ Thuellai love to engulf creatures in their blizzards, to lash buildings with ice and cold, and to trigger avalanches with their whirlwinds. They thrive on destruction and fear, and they share their master’s unpredictable nature.  \n_**Immune to Steel.**_ Northerners especially fear the thuellai because of their resistance to mundane steel, their terrifying howls, and their ability to cause madness.  \n_**Elemental Nature.**_ A theullali doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
