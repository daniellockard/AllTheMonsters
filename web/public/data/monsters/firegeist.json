  "desc": "_Made of fiery smoke coalescing into a vaguely humanoid shape, a firegeist is little more than wisps of black smoke and spots of brighter flame._  \n**Elemental Echoes.** When a fire elemental meets its destruction in a particularly humiliating fashion while summoned away from its home plane, what returns is a firegeist. Malevolent and resentful, less than their former prideful selves, they exist for revenge.  \n**Indiscrimate Arsonists.** Firegeists are not adept at telling one humanoid from another, and so burning any similar creature will do, providing it is flammable. Brighter Light, Darker Smoke. A firegeist can shine brightly or be primarily smoky and dark, as it wishes. It always sheds a little light, like a hooded lantern.  \n**Elemental Nature.** A firegeist doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
