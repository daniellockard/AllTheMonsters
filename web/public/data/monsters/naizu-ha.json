  "desc": "The old fable How Nuizamo Lost His Knife suggests every blade that has been used to kill is actually a naizu-ha in its native form. This is untrue, but the naizu-ha enjoy the myth and perpetuate it whenever possible._  \n**Daggers Personified.** The naizu-ha are the act of violence perpetrated by small blades given form. Dealings with naizu-ha are fraught with danger. Initially presumed to be good allies in battle, it was quickly discovered that they couldn’t be controlled in a pitched combat and eagerly lashed out at anything that came into reach. Most often, naizu-ha are summoned to assassinate specific targets.  \n**Impartial Betrayers.** A naizu-ha has no loyalty to anything but its own desire for blood and pain. If dispatched to kill someone, a naizu-ha can be coerced to switch sides with a promise that their new task will involve more violence than the current job does. They have no patience for subtle work or trickery that involves more than a quick feint. A favorite tactic of naizu-ha is to fulfill a contract, collect whatever payment has been agreed upon, and immediately murder the initial contractor.  \n**Bloody Biers.** To summon a naizu-ha, the blood of no fewer than three humanoids must be splashed on a stand forged of fused blades. If the petitioner uses their own blood in the ceremony, they have advantage on any ability checks they make to treat with the naizu-ha.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.",
