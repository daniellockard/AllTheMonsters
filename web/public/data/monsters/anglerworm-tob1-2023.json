When a creature that isn't an angler worm starts its turn within 60 feet of the orb and can see the light, it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of its next turn. While charmed, the creature must take the Dash action and move toward the light by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the light. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the charmed creature enters the worm's snares, it has disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid being restrained."

The web is difficult terrain, and the snares forming it are nearly transparent, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to notice them."
