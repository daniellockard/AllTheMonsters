If the wall falls in a creature's space when the arx places it, the creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage, and the arx determines to which side of the wall the creature is pushed. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and decides to which side of the wall it is pushed."
