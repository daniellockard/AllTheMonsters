  "desc": "This blue-skinned creature wears leather armor smeared with blood and filth, though the dagger it wields is immaculate. Its milky eyes complement equally white hair, which sprouts chaotically from its head. Its movements are twitchy and unpredictable.  \n_**Erratic Combatants.**_ Derro shadowseekers manifest their insanity in their physicality. They seem to have a continual series of muscle spasms that control their movements. Their apparent randomness is distracting to their foes, which enables them to better land killing blows. The bafflement they cause in combat also allows them to move about the battlefield without heed for their safety, as practiced blows fail to land on them.  \n_**Unreliable Allies.**_ Shadowseekers are aware they are more effective when allying with other creatures, but they detest working with others. If a situation forces shadowseekers to work with allies, they often mock their ostensible partners and work to maneuver their allies into unfavorable positions. A squabbling group of shadowseekers invokes a bewildering array of threats and ridicule that often throws off their foes.",
