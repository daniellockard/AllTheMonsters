  "desc": "_At rest, a clockwork abomination resembles a pile of debris and scrap on the ground, but in motion it reveals a large insectoid form with smoke rising between the plates of its hide. Its many orange‑yellow eyes shine like dim lanterns and reveal no hint of expression or intent._  \n**Bound Devils.** Clockwork abominations result from ill‑considered attempts to bind lesser devils into clockwork or steam-driven constructs. The disciplines of devil binding and engineering seemingly do not mix well, and the results of such attempts are typically disastrous. Every now and then, however, something goes right, and a clockwork abomination is created.  \n**Junk Collectors.** Clockwork abominations are canny enough to collect bits of old wagons, tools, or machinery as camouflage. Motionless among such objects, they can often surprise a foe.  \n**Sadistic Machines.** Malevolent in the extreme, these fiendish automatons are frustrated by the limits of their new forms, and they delight in inflicting suffering on others. Constantly seeking to break free of their creators’ control, the most they can be entrusted to do is to serve as a guardian or attack something.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork abomination doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
