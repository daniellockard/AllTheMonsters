  "desc": "_This hulking brass and iron creature resembles a giant suit of plate armor; a constant growl issues from its midsection. It stands 9 feet tall and its squat head wears an angry expression. A clockwork myrmidon always moves with moves with a powerful, determined grace unusual in most clockwork creations._  \n_**Elite Machines.**_ Clockwork myrmidons are heavily armored at their joints and at most vital parts. They are much too valuable to undertake patrols or menial labor, and they are unleashed only for dangerous situations that clockwork watchmen cannot handle.  \n_**Single Targets.**_ A clockwork myrmidon defends itself but does not initiate combat unless so directed by its master. When it does enter battle, a clockwork myrmidon is unrelenting and single-minded, and it attacks one particular target until that foe surrenders, escapes, or is defeated.  \nUnless given other instructions, a clockwork myrmidon attacks whatever enemy is closest to it. A clockwork myrmidon attacks until destroyed or ordered to stand down.  \n_**Alchemical Tricks.**_ A clockwork myrmidon is always outfitted with alchemical fire, acids, grease, and other special devices. An alchemist is required to keep one running well.  \n_**Constructed Nature.**_ A clockwork myrmidon doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
