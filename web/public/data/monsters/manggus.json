If all its heads die and the manggus still lives, the manggus immediately reverts to its true form and can't change into its hydra form again until it finishes a long rest.\n\nAt the end of its turn, the manggus regrows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The manggus regains 5 hp for each head regrown in this way."
