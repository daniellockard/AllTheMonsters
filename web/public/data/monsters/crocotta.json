  "desc": "A human voice emanates from a lion-like hyena. As it speaks, its black tongue runs over the many teeth in its unnaturally wide mouth._  \n**Disturbing Grin.** The crocotta’s mouth stretches back to its ears, allowing its powerful jaw to open unnaturally wide. In spite of its large mouth, the crocotta is able to perfectly mimic the sounds of humanoid voices. When hunting, it often mimics the sounds of a person in need, luring in a victim, then pounces on the victim when they investigate the sounds.  \n**Dog Hater.** The crocotta holds particular animosity toward dogs and attacks them before more obvious threats. Dogs innately understand this about crocotta and often purposefully distract an attacking crocotta to allow their humanoid families to escape.  \n**Oracular Eyes.** The gemstone eyes of the crocotta hold its prey captive when the crocotta is alive, but they grant visions of the future after its death. If a crocotta’s eye is placed under a creature’s tongue within five days of the crocotta’s death, the creature experiences omens of the future similar to those produced by the augury spell.",

If it does so, it can't see the crocotta until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the crocotta in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\nCanines are immune to the crocotta's Paralyzing Gaze, and canine-like humanoids, such as werewolves, have advantage on the saving throw."
