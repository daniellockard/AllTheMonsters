  "desc": "While the chitinous horn-like protrusion makes holler spiders appear comical, they can use it to release a loud sound, calling their masters when they detect trespassers. Unlike most spiders, holler spiders are easy to domesticate, as they have a friendly disposition toward humanoids. They can be trained to act as sentries that recognize certain colors or livery, or they can be trained to respond to a certain person and sound alarms only when instructed. Open Game License",
