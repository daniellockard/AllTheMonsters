  "desc": "This strange dog is hairless except for the thick, dark fur that runs along its bony, ridged back._  \n**Arctic Legends.** Oral histories of the north are rich with tales of the qiqirn. The tales say they are drawn to mankind’s warm hearths and homes and that the sounds of music and mirth enrage them. The stories note that qiqirn are jealous of dogs and that jealousy leads them to kill canines whenever they can. More than a few tales are told of qiqirn that have foolishly become trapped while trying to get at a settlement’s sled dogs. Most importantly, northern children are told that a qiqirn can be driven off by shouting its name at it.  \n**Afraid of Civilization.** Feared as they are by northern communities, qiqirn fear those people in turn. When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.  \n**Spirit Dog.** A qiqirn’s fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation.
