  "desc": "_These spotted and scaly quadrupeds run on hairless leonine paws, while their cat heads perch atop sinuous, serpentine necks._  \n**Swaying, Snakelike Cats.** Serpopards are 13 feet long and weigh 600 lb, with little gender dimorphism. They have feline bodies but long, serpentine necks topped by vaguely draconic heads. Their hairless paws have wickedly curved, retractable talons. A serpopard’s neck is in constant motion, swaying like a cobra, allowing it to track foes on all sides and to strike in unexpected directions.  \n**Easily Distracted.** Serpopards are foul-tempered predators and scavengers, and are known to occasionally resort to cannibalizing their weakest pack mate. They actively hunt humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to steal their kills—or to kill and eat the predators, then take their kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however. They can be distracted from a pursuit by the appearance of an easier meal.  \n**Musk Glands.** In some culture, serpopard pelts and musk glands are prized for use in fashion and perfumes. Images of these odd animals appear regularly in southern tomb iconography and temple decoration.",

      "desc": "The serpopard releases a jet of foul-smelling musk in a 15-foot cone that lasts for 2d4 rounds. Creatures in the cone must make DC 13 Dexterity saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature moves to the nearest empty space outside the cone; if the saving throw fails, the creature becomes drenched in musk. A creature that enters the area of the cone while the musk persists is saturated automatically. A creature saturated in musk is poisoned. In addition, every creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a saturated creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. Serpopard musk (and the poisoning) wear off naturally in 1d4 hours. A saturated creature can end the effect early by spending 20 minutes thoroughly washing itself, its clothes, and its equipment with water and soap."
