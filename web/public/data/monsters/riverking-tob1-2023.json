On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and is restrained. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, isn't restrained, and can choose to be pushed out of the whirlpool's space. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. While restrained, a creature is unable to breathe unless it can breathe water, and it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw at the end of each of its turns or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. A creature with a swimming speed has advantage on the saving throw and on the Strength check to escape."
