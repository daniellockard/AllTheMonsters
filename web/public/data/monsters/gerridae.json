  "desc": "_These large water-striding insects resemble a strange cross between camels and wingless, long-legged locusts. A rider can comfortably sit in the large hollow in the small of their backs, even at high speeds or on choppy water. Riders use the gerridae’s long, looping antennae to steer._  \n**Elvish Water Steeds.** Known by their Elvish name, these large fey water striders were enchanted and bred by the elves in ages past, when their explorers roamed the world. Elven mages started with normal water striders and—through elaborate magical procedures and complex cross-breeding programs— transformed the mundane water striders into large, docile mounts. They can cross large bodies of water quickly while carrying a humanoid rider, even in windy conditions.  \n**Sturdy Mounts.** A gerridae can carry up to 300 pounds of rider and gear before being encumbered, or 600 while encumbered.  \n**Fond of Sweet Scents.** Gerridae can sometimes be distracted by appealing scents, such as apple blossom or fresh hay. They are also fond of raw duck and swan.",
