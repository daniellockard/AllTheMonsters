Though the corpse is already decaying, the glob seems to accelerate the rot._  \n**Expediter of Decay.** The rotsam feeds on rotting flesh, encouraging decay in already rotten corpses and initiating decay in previously preserved corpses. Unfortunately, the rotsam can affect living tissue just as well and makes no distinction between the two.  \n**Leechlike Underwater Dwellers.** Rotsams attach to their prey like leeches, but they are considerably more difficult to remove than ordinary leeches.  \n**Favored of Rot Cults.** Cultists devoted to deities of disease, death, and decay “raise” rotsams for use in their sacrificial rituals.  \n**Ooze Nature.** A rotsam doesn’t require sleep.",

While attached, the rotsam doesn't attack. Instead, at the start of each of the rotsam's turns, the target takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If a creature ends its turn with a rotsam attached to it, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease (see the Bog Rot trait). The rotsam can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after the target contracts its disease or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the rotsam by succeeding on a DC 12 Strength check.",
