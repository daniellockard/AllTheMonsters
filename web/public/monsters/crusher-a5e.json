If the creature succeeds at a Strength saving throw  the crushers movement ends for the turn. If the creature succeeds at a Dexterity saving throw  the creature may use its reaction  if available  to move up to half its Speed without provoking opportunity attacks. The first time on the crushers turn that it enters a creatures space  the creature is knocked prone and takes 50 (10d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. A creature is prone while in the crushers space."
