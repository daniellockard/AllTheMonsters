  "desc": "This winged female has a short torso and long, gangly legs. Her wingspan is wider than her body is tall. Despite her awkward appearance, she moves with incredible grace._  \n**Protectors of the Marsh.** Egret harpies look after marshland flora and fauna, often allying themselves with druids and rangers who occupy the same area.  \n**Uncommonly Hospitable.** While most harpies have a reputation for sadism and bloodlust, egret harpies are considerably more welcoming. They possess the same alluring song all harpies have, but they can modulate the song to allow their captivated targets safe passage toward them. They often use their songs to prevent intruders from harming their home marshes. They can end their song in a mighty crescendo, imposing their will on those charmed by the song. The harpies typically coerce intruders to repair damages wreaked upon the marsh or to merely leave and never return. If a harpy suspects the intruders are unrepentant, she stops playing nice and allows her victims to fall prey to the marsh’s hazards.  \n**Powerful Yet Graceful.** The wings that hold the egret harpy’s larger frame aloft also serve as weapons. A powerful buffet from the harpy’s wing can knock down weaker foes. The harpy’s gawky build belies a fluidity to her movements, allowing her to balance on one leg even while engaged in battle.",
