  "desc": "A wrinkly, purple-skinned pixie with small black horns and bat wings flits about, chanting a violent song about harvesting organs._  \nCorrupted pixies are fey turned fiends who savor violence.  \n**Corrupted by Hags.** Hags sometimes capture pixies and torture them by forcing the tiny fey beings to watch the hags commit acts of depraved violence. These acts combined with the hags’ magic drive the pixies mad, twisting their forms and turning them into corrupt versions of what they once were. The corrupted pixies become fiends that live to serve the hags who created them. Many of these pixies think of their creators as gods who exposed the world’s true joys: murder, torture, and other evil acts.  \n**Mischief Makers.** Hags send corrupted pixies to cause mischief and chaos to punish their enemies, for their own entertainment, or as a distraction from the hags’ more sinister schemes. The pixies delight in these tasks, often using their magic to make people harm one another and remaining invisible as long as they can. Corrupted pixies like to make the pain last as long as possible before their tricks satisfyingly result in another creature’s death.  \n**Destroy Beauty.** Corrupted pixies take a special joy in destroying anything beautiful, be it a work of art, a garden, or the face of a handsome adventurer. The fiends sometimes become distracted from their hag-assigned tasks because the opportunity to mar something perfect is too good to pass up.  \n**Restored by Pixie Dust.** If a corrupted pixie is captured, it can be restored to its fey form. The captured pixie must be showered with pixie dust every day at sunrise for ten consecutive days. On the final day, the pixie reverts to its original form.",
