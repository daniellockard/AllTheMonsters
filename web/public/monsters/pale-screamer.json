  "desc": "This horrible, milk-white creature has the lower body of an emaciated humanoid and the upper body of a slimy jellyfish. Dark blue eyespots cover its upper body, and long, frilled, translucent tentacles trail from its frame-like tassels._  \n**Wailing in the Depths.** Adventurers traveling deep beneath the earth or in the ocean depths sometimes hear an unholy sound echoing toward them out of the blackness, followed by the sight of a creature that is neither human nor jellyfish. This is generally their first and last encounter with the pale screamer, a creature that haunts caves and waterways searching for victims to consume or transport back to the lairs of their terrible alien masters. The pale screamer pursues its mission with malicious relish and enjoys eating its prey alive, often in front of its victimsâ€™ paralyzed companions.  \n**Evil Blooms.** Though pale screamers are artificial creatures and do not breed naturally, their masters sometimes form them into blooms of two or more for mutual cooperation and protection. These pale screamers learn to communicate with one another by changing the coloration of their eyespots, allowing them to transmit information silently and better ambush or mislead their foes.  \n**Formerly Human.** Pale screamers are created by mixing human and jellyfish-like creatures together using twisted, magical surgery.
