The poisoned creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The poison remains on the weapon until the start of the drow's next turn.\n- **Beetle's Bite.** The target's speed is halved while poisoned.\n- **Dark Caress.** The target is blinded while poisoned.\n- **Nightmare's Kiss.** The target is frightened of the drow while poisoned.\n- **Slumber's Call.** The target falls unconscious while poisoned or until it takes damage or another creature uses an action to wake it."
