  "desc": "This elephant-sized feline has sleek fur, four upward-turned fangs in its mouth, and a long tail ending in multiple strands like a pheasant._  \n**Familial Bonds.** Zouyu live as mated pairs with large territories. The great felines are gentle and social creatures, often overlapping their territories for mutual protection.  \n**Good Luck.** For many, the zouyu are symbols of good luck and fortune. The tail feather of a zouyu, freely given, can be rendered into a liquid, which produces a luck potion. The potion brings minor good fortune, such as finding a fruit tree when hungry or shelter when it rains, to the drinker for a day. If a tail feather is taken without the zouyu’s knowledge, the potion created by the feather bestows bad luck on the drinker for a day. Such bad luck manifests as the drinker tripping over a too-perfectly-placed rock or a lightning strike felling a tree onto the drinker’s path.  \n**Herbivores.** Despite their fangs and sharp claws, zouyu are herbivores. Their preferred meals consist of fruit, bamboo leaves, and insects. The zouyu can survive on a very small amount of food despite their size.",
