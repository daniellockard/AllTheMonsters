  "desc": "Appearing to be an unkempt human child between the ages of six and ten, this creature has bare feet and long, ragged, dirty nails. The matted mop of hair upon the creatureâ€™s head has the odd blade of grass stuck in it. Its face is gaunt, with black, expressionless eyes, and its mouth is twisted into a sneer._  \n**Neglectful Beginnings.** Once children of the Material Plane, these poor souls were mistreated by their guardians or people in positions of authority. Through their sadness and neglect, they inadvertently opened doorways to the Shadow Realm, and, eager for an escape from their lives, they stepped through the doorways. Over time, the atmosphere of the Shadow Realm corrupted and twisted these children into feral creatures. Orphans of the black carry no weapons or belongings, except for a single tattered blanket or broken toy.  \n**Problem with Authority.** Orphans of the black hate those who hold command over others. Whenever possible, creatures prominently displaying rank or other titles, along with those who issue orders. An orphan of the black may sympathize with a creature that feels belittled or neglected, and it might forgo attacking the creature to attempt to coerce the creature into becoming an orphan of the black as well.",
