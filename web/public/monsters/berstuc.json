  "desc": "_Although slightly stooped, this male figure is muscular and broad-shouldered. The creature’s head is lost in a riot of moss, and a thick mustache and beard reach almost to its waist._  \nThe hulking, moss-haired berstuc looks sculpted out of a primordial forest—and it stands over 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. Despite its great stature, it seems strangely gentle, with a serene, almost soothing presence. Nothing could be further from the truth; the berstuc is a murderous demon that stalks woodlands and jungles of the Material Plane.  \n_**Poisoned Fruit.**_ Berstuc prowl forests in search of travellers to torment. A berstuc demon poses as a benevolent, or at least indifferent, wood spirit to gain the trust of mortals. It allows itself to be persuaded to help lost travellers (reluctantly) or to lead them to their destinations. Once it draws its unwitting prey deep into the woods, it strikes.  \n_**Verdant Nature.**_ The berstuc doesn’t require food or sleep.",
