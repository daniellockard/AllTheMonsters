The mix of runes flits about in random directions and remains inert except when it encounters living beings.  \n**Early Warning.** Runeswarms trigger their rune randomly, but the runes creating an effect light up moments before the swarms invoke the runes, giving canny observers the chance to prepare for the runeswarms’ effects.",

The beasts remain for 1 minute or until the runeswarm dies.\n2. Dagaz. The runeswarm emits a burst of blinding light.

A random willing target within 20 feet of the runeswarm gains the benefits of the expeditious retreat and freedom of movement spells for 1 minute.\n4. Ingwaz. A random willing target within 20 feet of the runeswarm receives a brief glimpse of the immediate future and has advantage on its next ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.\n5. Isaz, Kaunen, Sowilo, Turisaz. Fire, lightning, radiance, or cold winds swirl around the runeswarm. Each creature within 20 feet of the swarm must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold (isaz), fire (kaunen), radiant (sowilo) or lightning (turisaz) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Roll a d4 to determine the rune: isaz (1), kaunen (2), sowilo (3), turisaz (4).\n6. Tewaz. The runeswarm glows with a baleful light.
