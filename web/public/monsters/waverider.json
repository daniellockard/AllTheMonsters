  "desc": "The waveriders know firsthand the dangers of the open ocean, and dedicate their lives to protecting seafarers from storms, pirates, and sea monsters. Though they are not warriors, they are accomplished healers and aquatic empaths, using their powers to seek out and rescue survivors of marine disasters, sometimes returning critically wounded survivors to the tribe of elemental wardens itself. The isolationists among the water wardens condemn this practice, fearing that the refugees threaten their way of life. The waveriders take their peers’ scorn in stride, for they would rather be righteous than popular.\nA waverider turns to violence only as a last resort, and prefer to fight in fishform than with their fishing harpoon, using hit-and-run tactics as a shark or their octopus form’s natural camouflage to harry opponents. When patrolling the open seas, waveriders skim across the water on personal waveboards with folding sails, similar in function to the _skysails_ of the wind wardens.",
