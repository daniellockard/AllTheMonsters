Black liquid drips from its sharp mandibles. Its long arms end in sharp claws._  \n_**Everywhere Rhopalocerex Needs to Be.**_ The spawn of Rhopalocerex can be found near Rhopalocerex or in areas where the demon lord has some sort of vested interest. They serve as his direct agents, whether he is trying to establish alliances or going to war against some individual or group.  \n_**Lords of Butterflies and Moths.**_ Like the demon lord himself, the spawn of Rhopalocerex enjoy a special kinship with moths and butterflies. Moths and butterflies regularly accompany the spawn, aiding them whenever possible.  \n**Wardens of the Abyss.** The spawn of Rhopalocerex are the wardens of the deadly wild areas of the Abyss under Rhopalocerex’s control, defending it against all who would come to defile it. They originate at the demon lord’s lair in the great tree and fly beneath its wide boughs, looking for threats or awaiting missions to other planes.",
