The vesiculosa's pitcher produces enough water for plants to grow around it, provided the vesiculosa remains in the area for an extended period of time.

While charmed, the creature must move on its turn toward the vesiculosa by the safest available route to get within 5 feet of the plant and drink its water. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the vesiculosa's Sweet Fragrance for the next 24 hours."

An unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. Drinking the water provides a creature enough nourishment to sustain it for one day."
