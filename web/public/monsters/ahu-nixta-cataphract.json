After mastering clockwork design, the ahu-nixta turned to enhancing themselves to better utilize greater and greater clockwork creations.  \n**Evolved Terrors.** As ahu-nixta age and prove themselves against their peopleâ€™s enemies, they are forcibly evolved in eugenic chambers and given new armor.

Once out of its armor, the creature's pulpy mass no longer receives the benefits of the listed Damage or Condition Immunities, except for psychic and prone.\n\nWithout its clockwork armor, the ahu-nixta has the following statistics: AC 12, hp 37 (5d10 + 10), Strength 9 (-1), and all its modes of travel are reduced to 20 feet. In addition, it has no attack actions, though it can still cast its spells. The ahu-nixta's body can form eyes, mouths, and grabbing appendages. Its grabbing appendages can pick up objects and manipulate them, but the appendages can't be used for combat. The ahu-nixta's extra appendages can open and close glass-covered viewing ports in the clockwork armor, requiring no action, so it can see and interact with objects outside the armor. \n\nThe ahu-nixta can exit or enter its clockwork armor as a bonus action."
