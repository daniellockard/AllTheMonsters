Only the desperate or the suicidal travel to their volcanic temple-islands._  \nA demon lord bred the cruelty of a demon with the cunning of a human and the ferocity of an ape into his people, the behtu (BAY-too), who carry his worship from island to island.  \n**Temple Builders.** The behtus raise shrines to their demon lord wherever they go. Some are kept and prosper, while others fall into decay and return to the jungle.  \n**Ichor Drinkers.** In his volcanic temples, the demon lordâ€™s idols weep his ichorous demon blood, which the behtus use to create infusions that give them inhuman strength and speed. The behtus also use the infusions to etch demonic tattoos that grant them infernal powers and protection.  \n**Scaly Mounts.** The behtus breed demonic iguanas as war mounts (treat as giant lizards). The most powerful behtu sorcerers and druids have been known to ride large crimson drakes and small flame dragons as personal mounts.",
