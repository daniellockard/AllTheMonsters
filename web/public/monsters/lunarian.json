Its black lidless eyes are filled with envy and sorrow._  \n**Condemned to the Dark.** Lunarians are a race of mothlike fey originally from the moon. However, after attempting to take the moonâ€™s power for themselves, they were cast out by a fey lord and damned to the depths of the world, never to see their lunar home again.  \n**Angels of the Underworld.** Stories tell of lunarians helping people far below the surface, striking down monsters at the last moment. However, they never do so for free, often demanding valuable trinkets from the surface as payment for their services. If those they rescue deny them a reward or give them a bad one, they are prone to attack.",
