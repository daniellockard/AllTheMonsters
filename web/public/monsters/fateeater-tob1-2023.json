On a success, the creature takes half the damage, and its fate isn't altered. A creature with an altered fate for 1 minute or less can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, a creature with an altered fate can repeat the saving throw at the end of each long rest, ending the effect on itself on a success."
