Instead at start of each of demon's turns each creature with tentacle attached loses 11 (2d6+4) hp due to blood loss and demon gains equal temp hp equal. Demon can add temp hp gained from this attack together and can add it to temp hp gained from Release Swarm. Demon's temp hp can't exceed half its hp max. Demon can detach one or both tentacles as a bonus action. A creature including target can use its action to detach demon's tentacle by succeeding on a DC 17 Str check."
