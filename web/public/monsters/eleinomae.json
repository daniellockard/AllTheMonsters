  "desc": "_Eleinomae, or marsh nymphs, are beautiful fey who hold sway over many wetlands, from the chill to the tropical. They wear distinctive dresses fashioned from reeds and water lilies._  \n**Nets for Travelers.** Eleinomae are cruel and depraved creatures that seduce travelers with charms and illusions, then lead them to a watery grave. To capture their victims, eleinomae weave a net from swamp reeds and grasses, and decorate it with beautiful blossoms that release an intoxicating, bewitching aroma.  \n**Aquatic Cemeteries.** They are known to keep the most handsome captives as companionsâ€”for a time, at least, but they invariably grow weary of their company and drown them. Many eleinomae preserve the bodies of previous mates in aquatic cemeteries where the corpses float among fields of water lilies, and they spend much time singing to the dead. Such watery graveyards are often guarded by charmed allies of the eleinomae or other caretakers.  \n**Vain Singers.** While eleinomae have few weaknesses, their vanity and overconfidence can be exploited to vanquish them. They are proud of their sweet voices and clever creation of songs and harmonies.",
