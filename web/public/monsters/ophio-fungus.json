  "desc": "Row after row of bruise-purple fungus grows from the rocks like living shelves. The air becomes hazy as the fungus lets out a sudden puff of spores._  \n**Ambitious Parasite.** The ophio fungus is native to the subterranean caverns that wind through Leng, but it has no intention of remaining solely in its native world. The fungus seeks to infect as many carriers as possible to distribute itself across many planes and worlds.  \n**Mind Control.** The fungus attempts to infect carriers by issuing clouds of microscopic spores. Once inhaled, these spores attack the victimâ€™s brain, sapping their willpower and eventually leaving the victim under the control of the fungus.  \n**Master Plan.** Once a victim is infected with ophio spores, it is entirely under the control of the fungus, connected to the parent fungus by a psychic link that even reaches across planes. The fungus uses these victims to carry pieces of itself to other places or to lure more victims into its caverns.",
