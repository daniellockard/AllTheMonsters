  "desc": "Blanketed in a veil of mist, an enormous, centipede-like creature sifts its way through the swamp, the severed tail of a wyvern gripped tightly within its jaws._  \nWhenever an unnatural mist suddenly arises, some believe it to be the sign of a kirikari. Though they’re rare and solitary creatures, kirikari are considered highly dangerous due to their heightened aggression and territorial behavior.  \n**Ambush Predators.** Few can spot a kirikari in hiding, as it appears as little more than a collapsed tree concealed in fog. It then waits patiently for its prey to draw near—before striking out at them with its lightning-fast bite.  \n**Symbiotic Relationship.** The mist that covers a kirikari’s body comes from a unique type of mold that adheres to its carapace. The mold secretes an acid that evaporates harmlessly shortly after being exposed to air. The kirikari uses this mist to conceal itself and disorient its prey. Despite being natural-born swimmers, kirikari tend to avoid swimming in ocean waters, as exposure to salt quickly kills its mold.  \n**Wyvern Hunters.** Though unusual for its behavior, kirikari have been known to travel incredible distances to hunt down wyverns. Some scholars theorize that the toxins within a wyvern’s body are a necessary component in the maintenance of a kirikari’s mold.",
