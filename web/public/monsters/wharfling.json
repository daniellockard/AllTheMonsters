  "desc": "_Hairless, ugly, and usually dripping water, the wharfling is a nocturnal raider and fond of stealing from fishmongers and jewelers alike._  \n**Waterborne Packs.** Wharflings have large, webbed hands and feet and oversized mouths. An adept fish catcher, wharflings establish dens near the shores of oceans, lakes, and rivers, and they often move in family groups of 3 or more.  \n**Thieving Gits.** Those who have been bitten by a wharfling rightly fear their needle-like teeth, but most coastal communities hate the animal more for its propensity for theft. Their lairs are invariably filled with stolen metal trinkets.",
