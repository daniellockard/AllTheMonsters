The grimlock chooses one of the following objects:\n- **Flashing Rock.** The grimlock throws a warm, scintillating rock at the target that bursts with a myriad of colors. The target must succeed on a DC 11 DEX save or be blinded until the end of its next turn.\n- **Illusory Dancer.** The grimlock throws a small disk that emits a blurry, fractured illusion of a graceful, humanoid dancer. The target must succeed on a DC 11 CHA save or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn as it is mesmerized by the dance.\n- **Whirling Death.** The grimlock throws a small, bladed gear that grows larger and larger as it travels toward the target, threatening to slice the target into pieces. The target must succeed on a DC 11 WIS save or be frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, the target realizes the gear's growth was a magical, illusory effect and that the gear never increased in size."
