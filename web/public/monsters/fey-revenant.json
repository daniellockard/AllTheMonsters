She calls them to her court and blesses them with a measure of her power.  \n**Fey Transformation.** A fey revenant retains the upper torso of its shadow fey body, its skin becomes thorny and bark-like, and its lower body changes into that of an arachnid or insect. Spiders, scorpions, and beetles are the most common, but many fey revenants have lower bodies resembling dragonflies, wasps, and locusts. Fey revenants with insect bodies that can fly have a flying speed of 30 feet.",
