  "desc": "The mouth of this massive flytrap hangs limply, and the smell of decay emanates strongly from it._  \n**Disease Eater.** Viirets feed on diseased flesh and plant matter. The swamplands they inhabit are rife with maladies, giving them plenty of opportunity to find food. Viirets have an acute sense for diseased matter, regardless of the disease’s source. While they aren’t bothered by eating untainted prey, such prey isn’t as nutritionally satisfying. Their stomachs quickly burn through healthy prey, leaving the viiret hungry shortly afterward.  \n**Unpleasant Odor.** The viiret has developed a form of mimicry where its sickly odor deters healthy creatures from approaching it. The viiret is even repellent to most insects.  \n**Desperate Cure.** Marshland societies aware of the viirets’ ability to remove disease often view the plants as agents of harsh deities that demand a price for divine gifts. These societies send plague victims on dangerous pilgrimages to find the plants. The plants devour these pilgrims and remove diseased flesh. This process is dangerous, as many who enter the plant hopeful of eliminating the disease die as a result of the injuries they suffer. To mitigate this, multiple ill people travel together to viirets, optimistic the plants will expel newly healthy specimens in favor of a sickly one.",

If the target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the viiret. At the start of each of the viiret's turns, the creature takes 7 (2d6) acid damage. If the creature is poisoned or suffering from a disease, it takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the viiret's turns instead. In addition, at the start of each of the viiret's turns, a swallowed creature that is poisoned or suffering from a disease can repeat the condition or disease's saving throw as if it had taken a long rest, but it suffers no ill effects on a failed saving throw. The creature has advantage on this saving throw. The viiret can have only one creature swallowed at a time.\n\nIf the viiret takes 10 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the viiret must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone within 5 feet of the viiret. Alternatively, the viiret can regurgitate the creature as a bonus action, which it does if the swallowed creature isn't poisoned or suffering from a disease and a creature that is poisoned or suffering from a disease is within 60 feet of the viiret. If the viiret dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.",
