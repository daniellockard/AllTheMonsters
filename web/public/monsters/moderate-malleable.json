  "desc": "A pile of red, gooey flesh slurps along the ground. The meat climbs upon itself, squishing as it creates a formidable, hungry wall._  \nMalleables are malevolent, formless piles of flesh that absorb psychic energy and grow smarter and stronger when combined together.  \n**Consumers of Psychic Power.** Creatures that consume psychic energy can become so infused with it that their bodies implode. The power lingers in the grotesque mass of flesh, warping the creatureâ€™s mind even more than its body and creating a hunter that hungers to consume and grow. Malleables do not remember their personal lives before implosion, but they do retain facts and lore. They think themselves superior to all other creatures, which are simply prey. Their goals are simple: drain every creature they can of psychic energy and rule the world as a massive, roiling meat puddle. Malleables have infinite patience and can wait centuries until they feel the time is right to go on a psychic energy binge.  \n**Many Shapes.** Malleables have no set form, but they can stretch and alter their forms easily, moving on appendages or flowing like an ooze. They might form a face (or many faces at once) if they wish to convey an emotion to another creature, or take the shape of a truly terrifying beast (like a giant spider) if they wish to create panic. No matter the shape they take, malleables always appear to be a fleshy creature turned inside out.  \n**Our Powers Combined.** Malleables can join together, creating a larger, more powerful creature that shares the intellect of all the combined intelligences. These bigger malleables can separate into smaller aberrations when it suits them.  \n**Ancient Knowledge Hoarders.** It is said that malleables have perfect memories and the oldest of these creatures remember ancient lore other creatures have long forgotten. Many sages have tried and failed to capture malleables to prod their minds for secrets, but the creatures almost always find a way to escape. Adventurers are often given the dangerous tasks of capturing, guarding, or questioning a malleable.",
