They always have a mental link with their summoner, and often seek to destroy them.  \n**Devour Essences.** Soul eaters do not devour crude flesh, instead feasting on a victimâ€™s soul and spirit.  \n**Hatred of the Sun God.** They bear a particular antipathy for followers of the sun god, and they will go to great lengths to kill his clergy, even defying the wishes of their summoners on occasion.",
