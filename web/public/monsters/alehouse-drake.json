  "desc": "_This plump little creature reclines with a dazed look in its eyes and the suggestion of a grin on its fanged jaws._  \n**Scaled Barflies.** Alehouse drakes squat in busy bars, rowdy taverns, and bustling inns. A bane or savior to every bartender and innkeeper, alehouse drakes enjoy pushing patrons’ emotions, driving crowds to ecstatic cheers or bloody bar fights.  \nAlehouse drakes make their homes in cities and towns, though older drakes settle down in roadside coaching inns. In the former situations, they are often troublemakers or pranksters, but in the latter circumstances, they usually befriend the proprietor and help manage flared tempers and weepy drinkers in return for living space and a generous tab.  \n**Relentless Gossips.** Alehouse drakes gossip endlessly. Perched in hiding places throughout busy taverns, they overhear many stories, and often trade in information, making them good sources for news about town. More devious and ill-mannered alehouse drakes resort to blackmail, but usually only to secure a comfortable spot in their chosen tavern.  \n**Family Heirlooms.** Alehouse drakes are one to two feet long on average and weigh about eighteen lb. with a plump belly. Their scales are deep amber with cream or white highlights, and they possess glittering, light-colored eyes. The oldest recorded alehouse drake lived just past 400 years—some are quite beloved by innkeeping families, and treated bit like family heirlooms.",
