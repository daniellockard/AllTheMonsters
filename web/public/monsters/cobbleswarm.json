  "desc": "_The paving stones underfoot suddenly lurch and tumble over one another. Thousands of tiny limbs, pincers, and stingers break from the stony surface and frantically scuttle forward._  \nA cobbleswarm is made up of tiny, crablike creatures with smooth, stony shells. Individually they are referred to as cobbles. The creatures vary in size, shape, and color, but all have six segmented legs, a whiplike stinger, and a single eye.  \n**Paving Stone Mimics.** When the eye is closed and the limbs are pulled under the shell, cobbles are nearly indistinguishable from lifeless paving stones. Victims of cobbleswarms are caught unaware when the floor beneath them suddenly writhes and shifts, and dozens of eyes appear where there should be none.  \n**Trap Affinity.** Cobbleswarms have a rudimentary understanding of traps. They often hide in places where their shift and tumble ability can slide intruders into pits or across trapped areas, and kobold tribes prize them highly for this reason.",
