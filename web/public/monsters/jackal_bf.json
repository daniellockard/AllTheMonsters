Until the disease is cured, the creature is poisoned, and at the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or its STR score is reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's STR to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saves recovers from the disease."
