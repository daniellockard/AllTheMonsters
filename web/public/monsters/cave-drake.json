  "slug": "cave-drake",
  "desc": "Widely-spaced, large eyes sit on either side of the dragon’s broad, flat head, and sharp, curving teeth fill its fearsome maw. It clings to the ceiling, silently waiting for prey to appear below._  \nHighly adapted to hunting underground, this lesser cousin of true dragons stalks cavern passages for prey.  \n**Patient Predator.** An adult cave drake is between ten and fifteen feet long, with a thin, whip-like tail that nearly doubles its overall length. Its scales are dull and colored to match the surrounding stone. A cave drake hunts by lying in wait for prey to pass, often hanging from a wall or ceiling, before ambushing with its blinding venom. The drake then tracks the blinded creature as it flees, using a keen sense of smell and the creature’s disorientation to follow it. A cave drake will follow prey patiently for miles, unless its quarry wanders into the territory of another cave drake.  \n**Solitary Hunter.** The cave drake is a lone predator. It typically lairs in high-roofed caverns, atop sheer ledges, or in other areas where it can take advantage of its superior climbing ability. Each cave drake claims a wide expanse of tunnels and caverns as its territory. A cave drake will fight to defend its territory from all other creatures, including other cave drakes, with the exception of mating season, when territories fluctuate as female drakes search for mates. A female cave drake will lay two to five eggs, raising the young until they are able to hunt on their own, then driving them out.  \n**Hoards.** Like their true dragon kin, cave drakes collect treasure, favoring shiny metals and sparkling gemstones. They will often arrange such treasures near phosphorescent fungi, glowing crystals, or other sources of light. Unlike true dragons, cave drakes are not overly protective or jealous of their hoards. The more cunning of their kind often use such objects as bait to draw out greedy prey while they wait in ambush.",
