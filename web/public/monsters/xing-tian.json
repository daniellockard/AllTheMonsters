As punishment, his head was removed, but he simply grew eyes and a mouth on his chest and continued to fight.  \n**Fearless Warriors.** The xing tian, known by locals as “headless giants,” live on the fringes of civilization, occasionally raiding settlements for plunder and loot. They dwell in small, isolated villages where leadership roles go to the individuals who can withstand the most pain. The most powerful xing tian wear their hideous scars with pride.  \n**Symbol of Perseverance.** The xing tian’s fortitude and regenerative properties lead many to consider them a symbol of an indomitable will and the drive to continue no matter the hardships.",
