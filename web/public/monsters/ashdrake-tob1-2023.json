The ash moves with the drake, remaining centered on it for the duration."

On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
