  "desc": "_These shy fairies dress as small fey herdsmen wearing tan hide armor, hide boots, cloaks, and cowls, all trimmed in fox fur and often with a red sash or tunic. They often ride woodland creatures, such as dire weasels or snowy owls._  \nHunters & Herders. The far darrig were the hunters, herders, and equerry of the elven nobilityâ€”some still serve in this capacity in planes where the elves rule. Some stayed behind after the many of the fey retreated to wilder lands in the face of expanding human kingdoms.  \nFar darrig carry glaives made from fey antlers; each remains enchanted only as long as a far darrig holds it. Their leaders ride on fey elk the color of foxes, with gleaming green eyes; it is believed that their antlers are the ones used to make far darrig antler glaives.  \n**Hate Arcanists.** While not inherently evil, far darrig are hostile to all humans and will often attack human wizards, warlocks, and sorcerers on sight. If they can be moved to a friendly attitude through Persuasion or a charm spell or effect, they make very good guides, scouts, and hunters.  \n**Serve Hags and Worse.** They are sometimes found as thralls or scouts serving hags, trollkin, and shadow fey, but they are unwilling and distrustful allies at best.",
