  "desc": "A bipedal dinosaur with massive horns on its face, back, and tail roars, revealing an enormous mouth filled with rows of razor teeth._  \nTricenatoruses are the rage-filled result of a transmutation experiment gone wrong.  \n**Unnatural Mistakes.** A transmutation wizard attempted to magically bring together two dinosaurs to create the ultimate guardian, one with the power of the tyrannosaurus and the docile nature of the triceratops. Instead, the wizard created unnatural, spiked monsters with a hunger for flesh and an unmatched rage.  \n**Always Angry.** From the moment they hatch, tricenatoruses are angry. This rage makes them reckless and difficult to harm. Most of these monstrous dinosaurs stay deep within the jungle, but tricenatoruses are relentless when they find prey, leading them to sometimes chase explorers into civilized settlements.",
