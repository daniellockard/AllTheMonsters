  "desc": "_The frame of this withered demon’s corpse barely fills the ash-colored plate armor that encases it. It carries a serrated khopesh sword in spiked gauntlets that hiss with violet smoke, and a horned ivory mask devoid of features is nailed to its face._  \n**Children of Fiends.** Long ago, a demon lord of shadow and deceit fell in love with a demon goddess of destruction. At the base of a crater left by a meteor that destroyed a civilization, the two devised a plan to not merely slay their peers, but wholly expunge them from time itself, leaving only each other. Shortly thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.  \n**Rites of Annihilation.** To create these undead, the lord of shadows stole the bodies of death knights from beneath the necropolis of an arch-lich. Then, the goddess of the underworld sacrificed a million condemned souls and drained their essence into ivory masks—one for each fiend the couple sought to annihilate. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years.  \nWhen they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes to bury knowledge, conjure secrets, and erase their quarry from memory and history.  \n**Ready for Betrayal.** Kept secret from one another, though, the two each created an additional mask wight, a safeguard for in case betrayal should cross their lover’s mind.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
