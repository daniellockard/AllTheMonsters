They are frequently soldiers and servants to heralds of blood and darkness.  \n**Dissolve Bones.** A corrupting ooze can absorb an entire large animal or small person, simply dissolving everything including the bones in a matter of minutes. This function makes them an important element of certain dark rituals.",
