  "desc": "Frost moles primarily eat meat and supplement their diets with plants that eke out an existence in arctic climates. Though they can overpower prey with their claws, they prefer to ensnare their victims in pits they dig as traps. Since frost moles build their warrens near farms where they can grab more docile livestock, their lairs present a nuisance to those who work the land during the short growing seasons. Creatures capable of taming frost moles find them extremely valuable. Frost mole masters train the moles to excavate treacherous pits around their lairs, protecting the masters from intruders.",
