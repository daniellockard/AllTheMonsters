  "desc": "Resembling a giant scaled stoat with savage tusks jutting from the corners of its mouth, this monster bears a set of diaphanous, mothlike wings that radiate all the colors of the spectrum._  \n**Eaters of Magical Energy.** The werynax is a fearsome predator that supplements its diet with magical energy from the natural world, occasionally disrupting plant growth rates, water cycles, and weather patterns. Fortunately, werynax are solitary creatures, though female werynax are fiercely protective of their young and may have a litter of up to a dozen offspring. Most werynax live in forests and grasslands.  \n**Strange Habits.** Why and how werynax feed on the magical energy of the natural world has baffled sages and scholars throughout the centuries, though it is clear that the energy werynax consume grants them their magical abilities. Some sages point to magical experimentation on the part of an insane lich or fey lord, while others lay the blame at the feet of the gods, believing the werynax to be some form of divine punishment for misusing the land. Many druids, however, speculate the werynax is an integral part of the natural order—just as death and decay are part of the life cycle, so too is the werynax part of the land’s natural cycle.",
