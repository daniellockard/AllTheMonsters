  "desc": "_This swift-moving, lanky humanoid has long arms ending in wicked claws and jaws that open impossibly wide._  \n**Swift as Horses.** Distantly related to the trolls, the swift and nimble zimwi are a plague upon southern lands. Constantly hungry and illtempered, with the speed to run down horses, lone zimwi have been known to attack large caravans.  \n**Always Starving.** Most of their attacks are driven by hunger. The stomach of a zimwi is larger than its body, extending extradimensionally and driving the zimwi nearly insane with the constant sensation of emptiness, as though it is starving to death. Because of their endless hunger and low intelligence, zimwi have little awareness of the course of a battle. Losing means only that they have not eaten. As long as they continue to feast, they fight on, feeling victorious until death comes to them or all of their prey.  \n**Stomachs of Holding.** The mage-crafters discovered the secret to turning zimwi stomachs into extradimensional containers similar to bags of holding. Using a zimwi stomach in the creation of such items reduces the cost of materials by half.",

Damage done to a zimwi's stomach does not harm the zimwi. The zimwi's stomach is larger on the inside than the outside. It can have two Medium creatures or four Small or smaller creatures swallowed at one time.
