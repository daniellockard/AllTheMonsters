  "desc": "This bestial creature would stand over 15 feet tall if erect but is more comfortable crouched with its knuckles resting on the ground. It wears a pair of trousers and a vest, both obviously made for someone much smaller than it. Its cunning eyes belie a malignant intelligence._  \n**Bound to Service.** Though they are not devils, vexxeh are natives of the Hells. Their susceptibility to magical domination makes them ideal lieutenants for evil spellcasters. Once a vexxeh has agreed to serve a master, it adheres to the letter of the agreement that has been struck and refuses to break the contract even under the threat of destruction.  \n**Lovers of Carnage.** Vexxeh only know joy when they are harming living creatures. They relish battle, enjoying the opportunity to shed blood and break bones. More than combat, however, vexxeh enjoy torturing mortals, especially if there is no purpose to it. The psychic distress and trauma suffered by the victims of their torture makes vexxeh gleeful.  \n**Fiendishly Polite.** Despite their love of violence, vexxeh are unfailingly polite. They mimic the etiquette and social norms of their current masterâ€™s culture, going so far as to affect mannerisms of nobility. Even when rending a creature into bloody chunks, a vexxeh acts regretful and apologetic.",
