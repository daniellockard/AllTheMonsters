  "desc": "The large, smooth rock stands, the air around it humming with energy. As it walks, nearby daggers, lanterns, and buckled boots move to follow it._  \nMagnetic elementals spontaneously appear where the Plane of Earth meets the Plane of Air. They are magnetized, rocky creatures capable of switching their polarity to repel attacks and pull enemies closer.  \n**Smooth Stone.** Magnetic elementals are worn smooth by the elemental air that creates them. They are able to harness this air to fly, and, when on the Material Plane, they occupy areas where vast swaths of stone are exposed to the sky, such as mountain peaks and deep canyons.  \n**Iron Summons.** Spellcasters who want to conjure a magnetic elemental must mix iron shavings into the soft clay. Such spellcasters must take caution, however, as the elementals often inadvertently attract the armor and weapons of those nearby.  \n**Elemental Nature.** The magnetic elemental doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 5 feet of the magnetic elemental must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or the metal items worn or carried by it stick to the magnetic elemental. A creature that is made of metal or is wearing metal armor and that fails the saving throw is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). If the item is a weapon and the wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is stuck to the elemental and grappled (escape DC 15). A stuck object can't be used. Grappled and stuck creatures and objects move with the elemental when it moves. A creature can take its action to remove one creature or object from the elemental by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The magnetic elemental's Armor Class increases by 1 for each creature grappled in this way. \n* Push. Each creature that is wearing metal armor or holding a metal weapon within 10 feet of the elemental must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from the elemental. On a success, a target takes half the damage and isn't pushed. A creature grappled by the elemental has disadvantage on this saving throw."
