  "desc": "_These aggressive, blue-black freshwater crabs inhabit rivers and streams, scuttling along the muddy terrain in search of prey._  \n**Strangling Claws.** Garroter crabs are named for their abnormal right claws, which have evolved over time to strangle prey like a barbed whip.  \n**Clacking Hordes.** Their long whip-claw is lined with powerful muscles and joints at the beginning, middle, and end that give it great flexibility. During mating season, thousands of garroter crabs congregate in remote riverbanks and marshes, and the males whip their shells with a clacking sound to attract a mate.  \n**Small Prey.** Garroter crabs prey on rodents, cats, and other small animals caught by the riverbank.",
