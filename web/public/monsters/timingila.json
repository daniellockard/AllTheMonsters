Some scholarly tomes suggest a connection between the timingila and rarer leviathans but no definitive proof has yet been found.  \n**Master of the Seas.** The timingila is an apex predator of the oceans. It hunts whales primarily but eats anything it can catch. The timingila is fiercely territorial and considers all of the ocean its personal domain.",
