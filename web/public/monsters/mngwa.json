  "desc": "_Tiny wisps of grayish smoke ooze from the slate-colored coat of this leonine beast._  \n**Ethereal Lions.** The elusive mngwa (MING-wah; “the strange ones”) are the offspring of a sentient feline beast from the Ethereal Plane that mated with a lioness long ago. Also called nunda (“smoke-cats”), mngwas are strong and cunning hunters that can elude pursuit or approach their prey unnoticed by disappearing into the ether for a brief time.  \n**Rocky Terrain.** Mngwas choose their hunting ground carefully, avoiding flatlands where competing predators are plentiful. They favor rocky and treacherous terrain where their talent for dancing along the veil between worlds allows them to easily outmaneuver their prey.  \n**Feline Allies.** The strongest mngwa recruit other great cats into their prides, though these associations tend to be shortlived. They hunt with especially savage groups of nkosi, though only a great pridelord can command one during a hunt. When the hunt is over, the mngwa move on, and sometimes they take one of the young nkosi with them to become a shaman.",
