A placid herbivore content to go about its business, the beetle has a powerful defense mechanism in the form of a boiling liquid it can spray to scald would-be predators as it makes its escape.  \n_Many types of beetles inhabit the world, and, depending on the location and culture, they are used as food, companions, or beasts of burden by its people._  \n_**Forest Beetles.**_ Open Game License",
