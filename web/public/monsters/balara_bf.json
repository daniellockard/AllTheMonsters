On a failure, the creature is frightened until the start of its next turn, as the visions, fear, and pain of the last moments of several animals flash through its mind. While frightened, the creature's speed is reduced to 0, and it can't use reactions. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the save at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the balara until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the balara in the meantime, it must immediately make the save."
