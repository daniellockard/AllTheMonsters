Somewhere, dozens of them guard vast wealth.  \n**Spread by Spores.** Although not intended to reproduce, they began producing spores spontaneously and replicating themselves, so that now they’re spread across the deserts. Luckily for the other inhabitants, dune mimics reproduce just once per century.",
