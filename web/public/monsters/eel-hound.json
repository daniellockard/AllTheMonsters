  "desc": "_A grotesque beast with the muscular tail, bulbous head, and the rubbery, slime-covered flesh of a hideous eel, the torso and webbed paws of this amphibious predator resemble those of a misshapen canine. Needle-sharp teeth fill the creature’s menacing jaws._  \n**Hounds of the River Fey.** Ferocious aquatic fey, these amphibious menaces often serve such masters as lake and river trolls, lorelei, and nixies. Predatory beasts as dangerous on land as they are in the water, they share their masters’ capricious cruelty. The hounds’ chilling hunting cries inspire their masters to a killing frenzy as they pursue foes. Few other creatures appreciate eel hounds’ lithe power and cruel grace, instead noting only their grotesque form and unnerving savagery.  \n**Slippery Ambushers.** Eel hounds are ambush predators, preferring to hide among the muck and algae of riverbanks, only to suddenly burst forth as a pack. They surround their prey, latching on with their powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey are dragged into the depths to drown. Similarly, eel hounds often force aquatic prey up onto dry land to die of suffocation.  \nPossessed of a low cunning, they prepare ambushes by vomiting forth their slippery spittle where land animals come to drink or along game trails. They surge out of the water to snatch prey while it is off balance.  \n**Liquid Speech.** Eel hounds understand Sylvan, and those dwelling near humans or other races pick up a few words in other tongues.",
