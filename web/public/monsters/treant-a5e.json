The plant is immobile  but it acts on the treants initiative and can make slam attacks  or rock attacks if there are rocks to throw within 10 feet of it. Non-plant creatures treat the ground within 15 feet of the plant as difficult terrain  as surrounding roots conspire to trip and grasp moving creatures. The plant remains animated for 1 hour. If the treant uses this action while it has three plants animated in this way  the plant that has been animated the longest returns to normal."
