This collective negative emotion coalesces into a nebulous form that seeks out more despair.  \n**Whispers in the Darkness.** An incarnate gloom takes perverse pleasure in picking off members of a large group one at a time. It surrounds a chosen victim and telepathically imparts a sense of isolation on its quarry.  \n**Will-oâ€™-Wisp Symbiosis.** Incarnate glooms work with Open Game License",

A creature that chooses not to sidestep suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\n\nOn a failed save, the gloom enters the creature's space, the creature takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, suffers one level of exhaustion, and is engulfed in shadow. The engulfed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gloom, and it takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of the gloom's turns. When the gloom moves, the engulfed creature doesn't move with it.\n\nAn engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 18 Wisdom check. On a success, the creature escapes the gloom and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the gloom."
