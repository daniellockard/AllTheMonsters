The creature is encased in a sheath of thick orange jelly, almost as if it had been dipped in a giant pot of honey. The jelly wobbles and slides over the creatureâ€™s body as if alive._  \n**Sightless Alchemists.** The mydnari are an eyeless, evil subterranean race that lives alongside oozes. They delight in capturing other creatures and using the creatures for experimentation or as food for their colonies of oozes and slimes. They constantly experiment with new serums, tonics, and concoctions, striving to always improve themselves and their connection with their oozes.  \n**Bound in Jelly.** Each mydnari enters into a symbiotic relationship with a mutated strain of Open Game License",
