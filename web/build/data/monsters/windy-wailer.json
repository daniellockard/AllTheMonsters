Caught eternally in the last moments that took its life, the windy wailer seeks to spread its misery to others, raising the elements to overturn ships and drown sailors.  \n**Found in Storms.** Windy wailers are normally encountered in the midst of a great storm or other turbulent weather where they can hide amid the wind and rain before launching their attacks. They often strike when a group of sailors are at their most vulnerable, such as when the ship is close to rocks, the rigging has been damaged, or someone has been knocked overboard.  \n**Unusual Allies.** Aquatic undead, Open Game License",
