  "desc": "_Crashing through the forest, this three-headed dragon stands upright, its spiked tail thrashing from side to side as it walks. A vicious mouth lined with glistening teeth graces each head, and its green scales gleam in the fleeting sunlight._  \nHunting beneath the canopy of the forest, lurking below the surfaces of lakes, and guarding caves concealing great treasure and mystery, the zmey has two roles—vicious terror and nature’s protector.  \n**Claws of the Forest.** Single-mindedly destructive, the zmey keeps the heart of the forest free from interlopers. Rumors suggest the heart of an ancient forest itself can control the actions of these beasts, while others believe that they have a pact with certain forest druids. Certainly they are clever enough, often destroying bridges, dams, or logging camps infringing on their territory.  \n**Solitary Hunters.** Zmey avoid their own kind, seeking out isolated hunting grounds. They eat any organic matter, but they favor the fresh meat of large birds and mammals. The smarter the prey, the better, because zmey believe that intellect flavors the meat. They consider alseids, halflings, and gnomes especially succulent.  \n**Three-Headed Rage.** Dappled black and green scales cover this enormous beast and its three towering necks are long and powerful. Each neck is topped with an identical, menacing head, and each head is flanked by spiny, frilled membranes. A forked tongue flickers across long pale teeth, and six pairs of eyes burn red with rage.  \nWhen a zmey stands upright, it measures 25 feet from snout to tail. The beast weighs over 9,000 lb.",
