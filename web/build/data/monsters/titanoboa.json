  "desc": "_A This titanic green serpent can raise its enormous head high above, as much as 20 feet high. Its body extends in seemingly endless coils._  \n**Territorial and Aggressive.** Territorial and voracious, the rare titanoboa devours all trespassers in its domain. Stronger and faster than the giant anaconda, the true king of the rainforest is also more stubborn, fighting off entire groups of hunters and poachers. When stalking prey, these great serpents strike from ambush, swallowing even many dinosaurs in one bite.  \n**Blinding Scales.** Against groups of foes, titanoboas trust in their ability to dazzle their enemies with the light reflected from their scales, using this distraction to entwine the stunned foes in crushing coils.  \n**Slow to Mate.** Titanoboas mate rarely. They live for hundreds of years and never stop growing, which makes the need for propagation less urgent. When two titanoboas nest, the result is a brood of a half-dozen smaller snakes (giant constrictor snakes). An adult titanoboa is at least 80 feet long and weighs 6,000 lb. or more.",

A creature that averts its eyes can't see the titanoboa until the start of its next turn, when it can choose to avert its eyes again.
