Squeals mingle with the screams of unfortunate fishermen caught in its path.  \n**Beach Swarms.** Periodically, wharflings congregate in huge numbers and tear along the shoreline for miles before finally returning to their dens. Why they gather this way is unknown, but most locals know to avoid the shore on these nights.",
