  "desc": "A swarm of strange, faceless gray snakes flies through the air—wingless, as if through water. Their mouths are rasping irises of gnashing fangs, and the sides of each snake are lined with milky, unblinking eyes._  \nWhen enough serpents on the Astral Plane gather, they form a collective creature called an astral devourer. The astral devourer has a hive mind made up of all the minds of its component creatures and possesses a great cunning that makes it more adept at hunting.  \n**All for the Whole.** The individual astral serpents that make up the astral devourer have no thoughts or wills of their own, and the collective freely uses the individuals as weapons. The astral devourer often flings serpents at hard-to-reach prey to consume it. The flung serpents return to the astral devourer, bringing the consumed life force back to the collective. When food is particularly scarce or the devourer is in danger, it can split into subgroups of the main collective, feeding the individuals while keeping the whole safely dispersed.  \n**Planar Hunters.** Hunger constantly drives astral devourers. They love the taste of sentient planar travelers, and they roam the multiverse, favoring desolate landscapes. Reports indicate they’re adept at finding portals between worlds and relentlessly hunt prey through these portals.",
