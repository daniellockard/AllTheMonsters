  "desc": "_A toothless mouth adorns the headless shoulders of this oversized, four-armed, doughy humanoid. Colors and half-formed phantasmal shapes appear and vanish around it, to the creature’s obvious delight._  \n**Creative Chaos.** Wise yet child-like creatures of chaos, hunduns are four-armed, headless humanoids that embody spontaneous creation and the confusion that precedes enlightenment. Taking delight in creation of all kinds, they bring change to the staid and stagnant, spin revelation from confusion, and inspire moments of great creation—from works of art to new nations and faiths, and even the formation of planets and planes.  \n**Nonsense Speech.** Although not mindless, hunduns rarely seem to act out of conscious thought, yet their actions seem wise and usually benevolent. They communicate only in nonsense words, but have no trouble communicating among themselves or acting in coordination with other hunduns.  \n**Flesh of Creation.** Hundun blood is a powerful catalyst, and their spittle a potent drug. Each hundun’s heart is an Egg of Worlds—an artifact that can give birth to new concepts, powers, or even worlds. Obviously, the hundun must die for its heart to be used this way, but this is a sacrifice one might make willingly under the right circumstances.",
