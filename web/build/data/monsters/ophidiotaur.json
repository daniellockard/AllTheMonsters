Its hiss sounds like a hundred angry vipers, and the venom dripping from creatureâ€™s long fangs sizzles as it lands._  \n**Born from Corruption.** An ophidiotaur is created when a centaur is transformed via a foul ritual that combines its form with that of a venomous serpent. Most centaurs do not survive the process, but those that do can reproduce naturally, potentially creating even more of these serpentine monstrosities.  \n**Servants of Serpents.** Ophidiotaurs serve evil nagas, Open Game License",
