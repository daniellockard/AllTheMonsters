  "desc": "This draconic skeleton is surround by a nimbus of light, colored in such a way as to betray the undead creature’s living origins._  \nGraveyard dragons form out of the remains of evil dragons killed as part of a cataclysm that claimed the lives of several dragons at the same time, or when their remains are exposed to heavy concentrations of necrotic energy.  \n**Vindictive Undead.** Graveyard dragons are vengeful, like many other intelligent undead, but they focus their retribution on the ones responsible for their deaths rather than on their own kind. In fact, these undead dragons have a strange sense of protectiveness of other dragons, particularly for the type of dragons they were when they were alive. This sometimes extends to non-evil dragons, but most good-aligned dragons view the existence of graveyard dragons with distaste.  \n**Intimidating Appearance.** Graveyard dragons are particularly appealing to powerful undead as guardians for their lairs. A graveyard dragon’s skeletal appearance is often enough to scare away most adventurers and tomb robbers. Unlike a more traditional animated skeleton, however, the graveyard dragon is capable of handling the few tomb robbers foolhardy enough to face it.  \n**Undead Nature.** The graveyard dragon doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
