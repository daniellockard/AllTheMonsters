  "desc": "At first glance this creature resembles a satyr, its lower body covered in brown fur with goat-like hooves, yet the twisted horn sprouting from its forehead and the wide, manic grin on its comical face proves it is something far more dangerous._  \n**Devilish Fey.** While many fey are evil and twisted creatures, few are worse than the dreaded shurale, a deadly satyr-like monster that causes horrible hilarity with its ticklish touch. It inflicts a victim with a deadly bout of laughter that causes its internal organs to rupture and fail. After the victim dies, the shurale cuts it into pieces, leaving the remains for the scavengers.  \n**Feeds on Laughter.** A shurale feeds on the sobbing laughs of its victims as they expire, its own health mysteriously revitalized in the process. Because of this, shurale lairs are typically located within a few miles of a humanoid settlement, where it can easily lure lone inhabitants into the woods. While most of their prey are humanoids living in alpine or heavily forested regions, shurales are not picky and have been known to attack orcs, ogres, trolls, and even hill giants.  \n**Woodcutter’s Curse.** Many believe that a shurale is the spirit of a woodcutter who died a lonely and embittered death after being ridiculed by family. While such an occurrence would be exceedingly rare and most sages scoff at such suggestions, the shurale’s skill with the woodcutter’s axe and its strange behavior cannot be denied.",
