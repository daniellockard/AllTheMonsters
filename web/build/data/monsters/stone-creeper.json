  "desc": "This plant looks like a cluster of vines with elongated tendrils and leaves. A clear fluid drips from its thorns and spatters on the floor around it._  \n**Feed on Stone.** Stone creepers are semi-intelligent plants that feed on the mortar that holds structures together. They are commonly found in abandoned castles, ruins, and underground locations where the tunnels and chambers were reinforced with stone or brick. The stone creepers secrete acid into the mortar holding the building materials together, breaking it down quickly for easy consumption.  \n**Living Traps.** Stone creepers are typically found deeply enmeshed within stone or bricks and hidden in walls. Most creatures that initially see them assume they are ordinary vines. If there is a threat below them, they hastily withdraw from their position, dislodging the bricks or rocks that fall down upon the intruders.  \n**Semi-Social.** Stone creepers tend to live in groups of three to five. Often, they nearly encompass an entire room and feed upon it, waiting for hapless victims to enter a room. After they have consumed all the mortar and caused a collapse, they move on to new areas where they begin the process again.",

A creature, including the target, can take its action to remove the rubble and free the buried target by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check."
