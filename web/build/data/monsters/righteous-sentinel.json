  "desc": "Fierce determination emanates from the defensive stance the creature takes as torchlight dances off of its silvered body. It holds up its reflective shield, a disc-like extension of its metallic forearm._  \nTreasure hunters that pursue fiendish weapons of myth or enter temples to vicious entities may find themselves face-to-face with a righteous sentinel, eager to repel them.  \n**Keepers of Horror.** Good-aligned gods of peace have many methods for ensuring that defeated evils do not resurface in the future, and the righteous sentinel is one of their most effective. The constructs are placed as guards where great evil is housed to prevent anyone from accessing and awakening that which lies within.  \n**Abhors Violence.** Righteous sentinels seek to avoid violence as much as possible, but they react with unbridled rage when their ward is disturbed. When intruders disturb the objects of great evil the sentinels are protecting, the sentinel turns its reflective shield toward an intruder. The shield reflects a vision of that creatureâ€™s soul back toward it, which is often enough to horrify even the most evil of monsters.  \n**Construct Nature.** The righteous sentinel does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
