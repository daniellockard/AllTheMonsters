Creatures inside the shell can exit whenever they want but nothing can pass into the shell's dome unless the nautiloid allows it. Area inside dome is a magnificent palace carved into nautiloid's shell complete with open â€˜air' balconies used as entrances/exits and numerous covered chambers that can comfortably hold up to 50 passengers. Palace is 60' long 30' wide and 80' tall. When it dies any creatures inside dome are expelled into unoccupied spaces near the closest exit."
