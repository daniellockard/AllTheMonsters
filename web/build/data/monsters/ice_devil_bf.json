If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall, it can make a DC 17 DEX save. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.<br>The wall lasts 1 minute, until the devil creates a new wall, or until the devil dies. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 HP, is vulnerable to fire damage, and is immune to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage."
