They fled to the wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.  \n**Sea Godâ€™s Servants.** A few ancient titans still dwell in the ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black, red, or silver, and they stand 60 feet tall and weigh over 20 tons.  \n**Friends to Dragons.** Ancient titans have a strong rapport with wind and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral dragons.",

Any creature within 60 feet of the spot must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 28 (8d6) force damage, falls prone, and is pulled 1d6 x 10 feet toward the eldritch singularity, taking an additional 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage per 10 feet they were dragged. If the saving throw succeeds, the target takes half as much force damage and isn't knocked prone or pulled. The spot where the rupture occurs becomes the center of a 60-foot-radius antimagic field until the end of the ancient titan's next turn. The titan's spells are not affected by this antimagic field."
