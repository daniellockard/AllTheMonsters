  "desc": "The small cat emits a horrific yowl as its body begins to bulge and swell. Within moments, a massive, veined humanoid covered in patches of fur stands in the cat’s place, casting a mad gaze._  \n**Not of This World.** A catscratch comes from parts unknown. No one is quite sure of its source, but wherever domestic cats are found, these creatures appear. It is a hybrid monster, created when an aberrant virus infects a cat or cat-like humanoid.  \n**Summoned by Rage.** An infected cat doesn’t transform until it becomes angry, leaving many communities unaware of the disease until it is too late. Once a cat is sufficiently upset, it swells to a massive size, turning into a catscratch intent on destroying everything in sight.",
