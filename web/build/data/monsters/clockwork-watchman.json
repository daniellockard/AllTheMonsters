  "desc": "_This mechanical being’s body is composed of brass and iron and bedecked in a loose uniform of the city watch. Its movements are slow but steady._  \n**Lightly Armored Servants.** Clockwork watchmen are more solidly built versions of the more common clockwork scullions (servant creatures in wealthy households, incapable of combat). Proper clockwork watchmen are built with iron parts instead of tin, and given keener senses. Many have small bits of armor covering their joints and most vital parts.  \n**Constant Rounds.** They endlessly patrol the city day and night, pausing only to receive maintenance and new boots.  \n**Shouts & Stutters.** Their speech is slow and halting, but their distinctive shouts and whistles bring human guards at a run.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork watchman doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
