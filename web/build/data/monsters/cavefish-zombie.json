  "desc": "This creature looks like a bloated, wet corpse. Its fingers and toes are webbed, and slick, fleshy fins run down its spine and legs, poking through stretches of dead flesh. An overpowering stench of rot surrounds it._  \n**Aquatic Adaptations.** The cavefish zombie is an unusual type of undead that occurs when dark magic permeates a lightless, watery environment, such as in an underground lake or the depths of the ocean. Rather than retain the bodily form it possessed in life, the creature’s skin sloughs off from parts of its body as aquatic features burst through its flesh. Its fingers and toes become webbed, and fins form on its back and down its legs.  \n**Decay.** The cavefish zombie’s dead tissue holds water, causing it to look bloated and loose and afflicting it with a persistent rot. This rot results in a horrific odor, which follows them whether they are in water or on land.  \n**Undead Nature.** A cavefish zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
