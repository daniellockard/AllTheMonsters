At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 hour and have its Dexterity score reduced by 1d4. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease."
