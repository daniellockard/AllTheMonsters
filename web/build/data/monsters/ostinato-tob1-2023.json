The ostinato can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it can't attack. The host retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato's presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The host no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato's Magic Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. In addition, the host has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws, and it can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects. At the end of each long rest, the host can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check, realizing that the music it hears comes from an external entity on a success."

Each creature within 30 feet of the ostinato's host must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The ostinato then gains temporary hp equal to the single highest amount of psychic damage dealt. A deafened creature is immune to Contagious Tune."
