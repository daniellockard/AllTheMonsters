  "desc": "_Ychen bannogs are massive, ox-like beasts with thick, wooly coats and great horns like the godsâ€™ battering rams. They stand over 40 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh hundreds of tons. Despite their awe-inspiring size, these towering creatures are peaceful wanderers in the wilderness, where their calls echo for miles._  \n**Strongest Beasts in the World.** Legends are built on their sturdy backs. Capable of pulling 670 tons (or carrying 134 tons on their backs), ychen bannogs are the strongest beasts of burden in the known world. Tamed ychen bannogs can haul entire communities, or even small castles, and a clever dwarf with a ychen bannog at her disposal can carve out enormous riverbeds, haul enormous stones, or reshape entire valleys with ease.  \n**Ychen Warships.** Giants have a particular affinity with the ychen bannogs. In times of war, giants sometimes build complex siege platforms atop these beasts, making effective transport for small armies of giants. Thankfully, ychen bannogs are rare enough that even seeing one in an army is a tale to be told for generations.  \n**Louder Than Thunder.** When riled, a ychen bannog can bellow loudly enough to shatter stones and knock down walls.",
