  "desc": "_Dark, bark-like rust encrusts the trunk of this cold-forged metal tree, and its dull metallic leaves rustle with the sound of sharp metal._  \n**Cold Iron Trees.** These ferrous constructs are cold-forged in a process taking several years, as bits of rust and other oxidation are cultivated one layer at a time into bark and branches. In this way, the artificers create massive, twisted trunks resembling real, gnarled trees. Green-tinged leaves of beaten cold iron are welded in place by the master craftsmen, and trained warmages bring the construct to life through intense magical rituals rumored to take a full turn of seasons.  \n**Fey Destroyers.** The tree unswervingly obeys the commands of its creators, guarding key points of entry across fey rivers and streams, abandoned sacred groves deep in the forest, suspected faerie rings, or possible elf encampments. Many are released deep in the deep elvish woods with orders to attack any fey on sight. These feyward trees are rarely, if ever, heard from again and whether they leave a bloody trail of flayed elves in their wake after rampages lasting for decades or some fey counter-measure neutralizes them is unknown.  \n**Growing Numbers.** Each year, the feywardens order their construction and release, trusting in the destructive nature of the constructs. A half-dozen might guard a single ring of toppled elven standing stones. The feywardens leave nothing to chance.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A feyward tree doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
