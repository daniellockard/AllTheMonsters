If the weapon is being wielded by an attacker, the attacker must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or lose its weapon. For 1 minute, the reaver has resistance to the type of damage dealt by that weapon, and when it hits with its Bladed Fist, the fist deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage of the type dealt by the weapon. The reaver can absorb no more than three weapons in this way every 24 hours."
