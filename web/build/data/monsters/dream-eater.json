  "desc": "_This tattered skeletal humanoid resembles a monster from a nightmare. A dream eater’s natural form is mostly human in appearance, though with vestigial skeletal wings with a few feathers, small horns, sharp teeth, and cloven hooves. Most often they use magic to disguise themselves as attractive members of a humanoid race._  \n**Drawn to Sin.** Dream eaters are dedicated to lust, gluttony, and greed, and they make their lairs in casinos, brothels, thieves’ dens, and other locations where gambling, food, and other pleasures are readily available. Sometimes dream eaters work together to create such a place, especially near large towns or cities. Some band together to create traveling shows, offering all the oddities, whimsies, and flights of fantasy customary for such entertainers.  \n**Devouring Hopes.** Dream eaters lure people into their lairs, enticing them with promises of pleasure or wealth, but they make sure the odds are stacked in their favor. Eventually, their victims are left with nothing. Worse than the loss of physical treasures, though, dream eaters leave their victims stripped of all hopes and aspirations. Dream eaters feed on their emotions, leaving helpless thralls willing to sell their souls for their vices.  \n**Lords of Confusion.** When confronted, dream eaters are dangerous opponents. Using their innate abilities, they can drive enemies into a dream state, using the resulting confusion to make their escape while their foes destroy themselves.",
