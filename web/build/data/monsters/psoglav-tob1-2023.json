On a failure, the target is pushed up to 20 feet away from the psoglav, and its shadow becomes a creature under the psoglav's control for 24 hours or until the shadow is reduced to 0 hp. On a success, the target is pushed up to 10 feet away from the psoglav and its shadow isn't stolen. Each controlled shadow uses the statistics of a shadow, except it can't create shadows from killing Humanoids. The psoglav can have no more than five shadows under its control at a time. The shadow becomes permanently under the psoglav's control if the shadow's original owner dies."
