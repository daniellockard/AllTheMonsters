  "desc": "Screams echo in the night as spears meet wood and flesh. One trollkin pulls its spear from its latest victim while its companion raids the victimâ€™s larder._  \nTrollkin raiders are greedy and efficient, moving together under the command of a trollkin leader to take apart a village, a caravan, or a small fortress. Their goal is generally food and portable wealth. Their training as a unit is not extensive but raiders know, trust, and fight for one another.  \n**Night Attacks.** Trollkin raiders attack in a fast-moving, nocturnal group, often using a group of panicked animals or a fire as a distraction in one place while they attack elsewhere. Their assaults are never daylight attacks over open ground; they much prefer surprise and the confusion of night attacks.  \n**Mounted or River Routes.** While trollkin raiders can lope for miles across taiga or through forests, they far prefer to ride horses or row up a river. It gives them both speed and the ability to carry more plunder.  \nNote that in The Raven's Call, the Raider had 78 (12d8 + 24) HP and spoke only Northern Tongue.",
