Alternatively, when a creature the golem can see within 30 feet of the golem starts its turn while under the effects of a spell, such as bless or heroes' feast, the golem can absorb the spell's magic, ending the effect. In either case, the golem's ability check for this is +10. If it successfully counters or ends the spell, it becomes Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait).
