When the giants declined to go to war with the shadow fey, the fey exiled them to the Shadow  \n**Realm.** When they refused to serve the dark fey courts, the queen cursed them into their current form.  \n**Of Two Worlds.** Shadow giants are cursed to exist simultaneously on the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane. Unable to properly live in either world, they have become embittered and indignant. Shadow giants desire to end their cursed existence but lash out against anyone who shows them pity or mercy.  \n**Undying.** When a shadow giant is killed, its spirit roils in the Shadow Realm for a century before it is reborn to its cursed fate.",
