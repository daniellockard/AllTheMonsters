The area within 5 feet of the anubian is heavily obscured. A creature that starts its turn in that area or enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the storm. While restrained, the creature takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns, and moves with the anubian when the anubian moves. A creature, including the restrained creature, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check."
