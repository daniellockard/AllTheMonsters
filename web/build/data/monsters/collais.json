The monster has no mouth; instead, a coarse beard grows in its place._  \n**Summoned Protector.** If a forest village is in danger, the villagers might perform a ritual sacrifice to summon a colláis. Once the ritual is complete, the creature appears in the branches of a nearby tree. It then stalks the village and its surroundings. A colláis returns to its home plane after 24 hours.",
