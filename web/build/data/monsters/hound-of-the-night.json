  "desc": "_These enormous black hounds are most commonly seen panting in the moonlight, wisps of steam rising from their muzzles, while they accompany a nocturnal hunting party._  \n**Fey Bloodhounds.** Hounds of the night are bred by the shadow fey for use as hunting companions and guardians, and they excel at both tasks. Far more intelligent than other hounds, they are difficult to evade once they are on a quarryâ€™s trail, because they can think their way past problems that would throw their lesser kin off the trail. Their shadow fey masters claim that hounds of the night can smell a shadow on running water and can sniff out a ghost passing through a wall.  \n**Cousins to Winter.** Somewhere in their early existence as a breed, some enterprising hunter interbred them with winter wolves. Every trace of their white fur is long gone, but the cold breath of those dread canines remains.  \n**Dimensional Stepping.** Hounds of night excel at distracting prey while some of their pack uses dimension door to achieve some larger goal, such as dragging off a treasure or overwhelming a spellcaster in the back ranks.",
