  "desc": "These glyph-covered metal spiders slowly crawl over the cracked temples of beings beyond the minds of mortals._  \nDread walker excavators are spider-shaped constructs developed to protect and excavate ancient, magical ruins. Excavators are found deep underwater or in wastelands, crawling over monuments built hundreds of years ago.  \n**Alien Minds.** The minds of the excavators are completely mysterious, their instructions indecipherable. Excavators are able to communicate with one another, and supposedly with their masters, but the transmission path of this communication is unknown.  \n**Dread Eye.** The excavator’s central eye shines complicated diagrams atop the stonework of ancient ruins, imprinting alien glyphs atop those carved hundreds of years previously. Some believe the excavators contain vast knowledge of ancient magic and lost civilizations, and sages greatly desire destroyed excavators, hoping to extract this knowledge from their remains. None have yet been successful, and many have been driven mad by the attempt.  \n**Construct Nature.** A dread walker excavator doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
