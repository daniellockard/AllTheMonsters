The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks but before moving into damaging terrain such as lava or a pit and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the sinstar the creature can repeat the save. A charmed creature can also re-save at end of each of its turns. If the save is successful the effect ends on it.

On a failure the creature's Dex and Int scores are each reduced by 1d4. The reductions last until the infected creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The infected creature dies if the disease reduces its Dex or Int score to 0. A Humanoid that dies from this disease transforms into a star thrall under the complete psychic control of the sinstar that infected it. This otherworldly disease can be removed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic."
