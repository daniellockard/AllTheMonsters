  "desc": "In swampy areas where food is plentiful, leeches gather together in swarms numbering in the hundreds to hunt prey. When their food supply is diminished, the leeches often turn on each other, effectively destroying the swarm. The scent of blood attracts leech swarms, and they easily locate warm-blooded prey. Victims who move out of a leech swarm are not safe, as several leeches remain attached and continue to drain blood until they are removed. These hangers-on are adept at locating hard-to-reach places on their prey as they wriggle into gaps in armor or crawl into boots. Their victims must spend extra time to locate and remove them.",
