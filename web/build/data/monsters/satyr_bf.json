The target must succeed on a DC 13 CHA save or gain the listed effect. A willing creature can choose to fail the save.\n- **Celebrate.** The target feels invigorated by the music, dancing along with it. Until the start of the satyr's next turn, the target has advantage on DEX saves and on the next attack roll it makes.\n- **Overindulge.** The satyr's song is laced with magical enchantments, and the target is forced to dance along with the music. Until the start of the satyr's next turn, the target is charmed, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet, as it dances uncontrollably.\n- **Unnerve.** The satyr's song and dance turn frightful with heavy stomps, shrill notes, and a rapid, staccato melody. The target is frightened until the end of its next turn."
