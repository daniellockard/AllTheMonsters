  "desc": "The ticking of metal gears is all that hints at the presence of a pair of feline-shaped metal creatures. They are bronze and steel, with sharp metal teeth and razor claws._  \n**Magical Origin.** Clockwork tigers were invented as guardians in times now long forgotten. In spite of their age, they continue to serve their original purpose as guardians, protecting ancient ruins and new masters alike. The number of clockwork tigers in existence is slowly rising, leading many scholars to speculate on the reason. Some suspect the instructions for creating them were finally found, while others surmise a natural phenomenon unearthed a lost vault of clockwork tigers.  \n**Found in Pairs.** Clockwork tigers are almost always found in pairs and almost always guarding a spellcaster or magical object, which they consider their “ward.” The tigers work in tandem to defeat threats and protect their wards, leaping in and out of combat. Their clockwork brains are capable of thought, but they are less interested in communication and wholly devoted to protecting their wards.  \n**Construct Nature.** A clockwork tiger doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
