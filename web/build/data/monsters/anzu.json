  "desc": "A giant raptor roars out its fury in spouts of fire and scalding water while lightning crackles through its feathers._  \n**Territorial.** Anzu are fierce and territorial predators, claiming ranges along the edges of deserts, wide grasslands, or high mountains. Extremely long-lived, they mate for life, producing two or three eggs every decade.  \n**Elemental Birthright.** Offspring of a wind god or primordial wind spirit, anzu are the personification of the south wind, lightning, and the driving monsoon. Uniquely tied to the elements of fire, water, and wind, they react poorly to weather-altering magic.",
