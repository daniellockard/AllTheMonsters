The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (4d4) poison damage and is euphoric for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't euphoric. A euphoric creature has disadvantage on saving throws.

Otherwise, a creature that fails the save is incapacitated and its speed is reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn, as it remains transfixed in place by the glitter of the swarm.
