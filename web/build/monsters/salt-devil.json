  "desc": "_“They led that caravan without mercy or kindness. If you fell or stumbled, they struck you, making your tongue feel as sand or your body ache with pain, then laughed, telling you to get up. And once we arrived, gods, they had us take the tools from the dead, withered hands of the last slaves, and start digging.” He took a drink from his waterskin, as if just the memory made him thirsty._  \n**Sparkly Crystals.** Salt devils have sharp, crystalline teeth, sparkling skin studded with fine salt crystals, and long claws that leave jagged, burning wounds. They can also fight with saltencrusted blades seemingly forged from thin air.  \n**Servants of Mammon.** Salt devils claim to serve Mammon, and they often ally with gnolls and slavers with whom they seek out oases to use as ambush sites or just to poison the water.  \n**Slavers and Corruptors.** Salt devils create slave markets and salt mines, where they thrive on the misery of those indentured into their service. They detest summoning peers during combat because they hate being indebted to another devil. They prefer to forge alliances with mortals when partners are needed for an endeavor, and they are less grasping and greedy than one might expect of Mammon’s servants, preferring to encourage corruption in others.",
