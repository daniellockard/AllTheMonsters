  "desc": "_Dank winds sweep up skeletons, both humanoid and animal. They blow forward, reaching out for living creatures like a clawed hand of bone. A scattering of bones rolls across the ground, then rises into the air, billowing like a sheet._  \n**Swarms of Fallen.** On rare occasions, the pugnacious spirits of fallen undead join together, bonded by a common craving: to feel alive again. They gather up their bones from life, as well as any other bones they come across, and form bone swarms.  \n**Nomadic Undead.** These swarms then ravage the countryside wresting life from living creatures, grabbing livestock, humanoids, and even dragons, digging in their claws in an attempt to cling to life. Bone swarms with one or more sets of jaws wail constantly in their sorrow, interrupting their cries with snippets of rational but scattered speech declaiming their woes and despair.  \n**Cliff and Pit Dwellers.** Bone swarms gather near cliffs, crevasses, and pits in the hope of forcing a victim or an entire herd of animals to fall to its death, creating more shattered bones to add to their mass.  \n**Undead Nature.** A mask wight doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
