  "desc": "A massive worm bursts through the ground, its body covered in bony protrusions._  \nBonespitters are bone-covered predators that live in the soft soil of grassy plains.  \n**Bones of Victims.** Bonespitters have unique digestive systems. When a bonespitter consumes another creature, the acid in the worm’s stomach dissolves all of the prey’s tissue and leaves only bones behind. The bones become part of the bonespitter’s defenses, poking through its skin like sharp hair follicles. Other bones are stored in muscular sacks in the bonespitter’s mouth, waiting to be unleashed on unsuspecting prey.",
