  "desc": "A writhing mass of hundreds of rubbery, blue-grey tentacles rises from a human sized pair of legs ending in elephantine feet. Each tentacle ends in an eerily human-looking mouth._  \n**Damned Pipers.** Vangsluagh create a din everywhere they go; the mouths on their tentacles perpetually scream, whistle, bleat, growl, and cry. Even in instances where a vangsluagh may want a quiet entrance or stealthy ambush, their own bodies betray them. Stories have emerged from their magic-blasted homeland of vangsluagh that are capable of silencing the noise surrounding them.  \n**Defilers of Beauty.** Vangsluagh despise pretty things, be they creature, object, or structure. Given the opportunity, a vangsluagh prefers spending its time smashing beautiful things to bits. The absence of beauty doesnâ€™t always calm these creatures, however. They target living creatures as a priority in such occurrences.",
