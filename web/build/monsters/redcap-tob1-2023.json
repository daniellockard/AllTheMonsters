Every 24 hours past the third day that it goes without soaking its cap in blood in this way, it suffers one level of exhaustion. This exhaustion can be reduced only when the redcap finishes a long rest after soaking its cap in fresh Humanoid blood, which reduces its exhaustion level to 0. If the redcap dies as a result of this exhaustion, it crumbles to dust."
