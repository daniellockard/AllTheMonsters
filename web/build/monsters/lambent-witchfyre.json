  "desc": "A creature of pure blue fire trickles across the cavern floor, burning and devouring all except the stone._  \nThough its behavior is similar to oozes that infest subterranean areas, the lambent witchfyre is composed of living blue flame, not protoplasm. Like liquid fire, it flows along the ground, searching for food, which, in the case of the lambent witchfyre, is any organic matter that can burn.  \n**Arcane or Alien Origins.** The lambent witchfyre’s exact origins are unknown. Some sages speculate that it was an early attempt by a wizard to infuse life on the Material Plane with elemental essence. Others theorize it is the disastrous byproduct of spell experimentation on an extra-planar creature. Whatever the truth, these strange beings have multiplied and spread, posing a deadly hazard to those who explore the deep caves of the world.  \n**Reproduction.** When a lambent witchfyre has consumed enough organic material, it will seek an isolated place in which to reproduce. It then divides itself into two new lambent witchfyres, each starting with half the parent’s hit points. The offspring then go their separate ways, seeking more life to devour",
