  "desc": "The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \nTosculi elite bow raiders are smarter and more capable than drones and common warriors, with midnight black or deep green carapaces that shine with colorful iridescence. Their wings are blood red, streaked with dark crimson veins. Elite bow raiders also tower over common tosculi—they stand over 5 feet tall and weigh 130 lb.  \n**Warband Leaders.** Elite bow raiders lead larger raiding parties of warriors and drones to gather slaves and sacrifices. As rare and prized members of the hive, a bow raider’s life is never thrown away like drones’ or risked unnecessarily. Seldom does a tosculi warband contain more than a handful of these elite soldiers, and they frequently hold positions of command. Elite bow raiders always lead the honor guard for their hive-queen, both within the hive and on those rare occasions when the queen ventures outside.",
