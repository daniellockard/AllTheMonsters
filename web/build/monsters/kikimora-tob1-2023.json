Only the kikimora can enter this space, along with any nonmagical objects it is wearing or carrying, up to the extradimensional space's limits. While inside the extradimensional space, the kikimora can see out as if through a 2-foot-by-2-foot window centered on the symbol and can exit the space as an action, appearing in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the surface where the symbol is inscribed."
