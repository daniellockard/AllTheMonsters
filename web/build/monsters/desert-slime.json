The restrained creature must re-save at end of each of turns being pulled prone on a failure. A restrained creature takes 10 (3d6) acid at start of each of slime's turns. If restrained creature is also prone it is unable to breathe or cast spells with verbal components. Slime can have only one creature mired at a time and a mired creature moves with the slime when it moves. A creature including a restrained target can take its action to pull the restrained creature out of the slime by succeeding on a DC 13 Str check. The creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid."
