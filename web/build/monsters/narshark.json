Its mouth is filled with several rows of vicious teeth, and an ivory horn emerges from the top of its head._  \n**Aerial Predators.** A narshark is a creature that resembles a cross between a shark and a narwhal with dark blue skin, long serrated teeth, and a horn growing from its brow. Like many sharks, the narshark is a rapacious predator, hunting birds through the sky as a shark hunts fish. While it lacks the keen nose of most predators, the narshark has excellent eyesight and can pick out details at great distances. While narsharks are dangerous predators, they are seldom top of the aerial food chain and face fierce competition from Open Game License",

The horn can be severed from a living narshark, but doing so drives it into a panicked rage as it attempts to slay all those around it. Strangely, narsharks never use their horns in combat, possibly in fear of accidentally breaking them. A narshark's horn is commonly used in the creation of magic items that grant flight, and narsharks are often the target of hunters seeking to turn a profit."
