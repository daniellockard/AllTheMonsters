Another shadowy grin appears on top of the ghoul’s and extends out, consuming all it touches._  \n**Worshiper of Hunger.** The Unsated God, is a god of death, hunger, and the undead. The bulk of his followers, especially in the deep caverns of the world, are undead. The most common of these followers are darakhul— intelligent and civilized ghouls—who share their lord’s unholy hunger. The servants of the Unsated God act as civil officials, support the imperial army, and spread the faith (often by slaying intruding surface dwellers then recruiting them as newly risen undead).  \n**Hungry Dead Nature.** The ghoul requires no air or sleep.",
