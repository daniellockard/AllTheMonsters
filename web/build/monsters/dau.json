  "desc": "_A constant shimmer surrounds this short, winged creature, and staring at it is eyewatering and confusing, like a distant desert mirage though it’s only scant yards away._  \n**Desert Mirage Fey.** Daus are creatures of haze and illusion. They stand three feet tall, with sandy skin, and are surrounded by a shimmering aura like a heat haze. They are flighty, physically weak, and unfocused, but are agile in both body and wit.  \n**Lazy and Bored.** Their ability to magically provide for themselves in most material ways tends to make daus lazy and hedonistic. As a result, daus are often friendly and eager for company and they invite friends and strangers alike to rest in their lairs, partake in their feasts and share their stories.  \n**Sticklers for Etiquette.** However, a dau’s hospitality often turns to cruelty when guests breach its intricate rules of etiquette.",
