  "desc": "_This swanlike creature’s feathers are made of shining metal. When it inhales, the feathers on its chest glow red hot._  \nEala are beautiful but deadly creatures native to the plane of Shadow. They grow feathers like their Material Plane counterparts, but their feathers are made of gleaming, razor‑sharp metal.  \n**Metallic Diet.** Eala plumage displays a stunning mixture of metallic colors, which vary depending on their diet. An eala uses its fire breath to melt metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, and bronze. The eala consumes the molten metal, some of which migrates into the creature’s deadly feathers. Eala that display primarily or entirely a single color are highly prized.",
