The two forms can rejoin into the fiend's whole form as a bonus action if they are within 5 feet of each other. If the head is destroyed while it is detached, the body also perishes. If the body is destroyed while the head is detached, the head has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until it acquires a new body. A creature within 30 feet of the penanggal and that can see the detachment must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.
