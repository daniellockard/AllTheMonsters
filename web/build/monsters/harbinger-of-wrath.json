  "desc": "Twisting adamantine spikes topped with an array of demonic and bestial skulls form the vaguely humanoid creature. It makes a loud screeching sound as it crushes everything in its path._  \n**Engines of Decimation.** The harbinger of wrath is a construct of immense size and destructive potential. Just seeing a harbinger causes most creatures to flee in terror, and few are willing or able to face one in battle. Creatures allied with a harbinger must also fear its terrible wrath, as it is not against skewering its allies on its many spikes to rejuvenate itself in the heat of battle.  \n**Forged by Demons.** The first harbingers were created in vast demonic forges by a powerful demon prince to use against his enemies. Since then, the construction process has passed to other demon princes and evil gods that delight in devastation and mayhem.  \n**Construct Nature.** A harbinger doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
