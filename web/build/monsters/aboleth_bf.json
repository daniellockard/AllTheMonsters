Every 24 hours that elapse, the infected creature must make a DC 16 CHA save. Each time a creature fails this save, it views the infecting aboleth more and more favorably, becoming the aboleth's doting and protective thrall after three failed saves.<br>The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, but once a creature has acquired three of a kind, it no longer has to make this save, resulting in either the creature becoming a thrall of the aboleth or an autonomous - though infected - creature. _Slime pox_ can be cured only by the heal spell or similar magic."
