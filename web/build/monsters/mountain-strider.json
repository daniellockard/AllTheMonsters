  "desc": "These large creatures stand upright, with exceptionally powerful legs that end in cloven hooves. Their upper bodies are muscular beneath their snowy-white fur, and their heads resemble those of goats._  \n**Dwellers of Mountains.** Mountain striders are most at home in the mountains. They live among the peaks, climbing seemingly impossible slopes to make their homes in the caves and burrows they dig near the tops. Ages ago, they had amicable relations with nearby settlements, but their aggressive behavior and boorish attitudes led to conflicts with the populace. They were subsequently made to withdraw from civilization as a result. In the years since, they have become an insular people, fearful of outsiders and resentful of civilization.  \n**Communal.** Mountain striders live in communal groups that travel the mountains, moving with the seasons. They are highly protective of each other and go into a brief rage when one of their number falls. Their nomadic and overly protective natures occasionally bring them into conflict with dwarves, though the two don’t actively hunt each other.  \n**Bleating Communication.** The weather on the highest mountain peaks can turn at a moment’s notice, separating family groups within minutes. The mountain striders adapted to such dangers by developing complex bleating calls. Over time, these calls became part of the mountain striders’ culture, seeing use outside of emergency situations. The calls range from simple notifications of an individual’s location or health to short songs identifying family affiliation and lineage.",
