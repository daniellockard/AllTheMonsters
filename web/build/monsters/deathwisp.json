  "desc": "_A shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points of light._  \n**Unnatural Aura.** Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a deathwisp, unless a master makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check.  \n**Fey Undead.** A deathwisp is a wraith-like spirit created in the Shadow Realm from the violent death of a shadow fey or evil fey.  \n**Rift Walkers.** Many deathwisps remain among the shadows, but a few enter the natural world through planar rifts and gates, or by walking along shadow roads between the worlds. Retaining only a trace of their former personality and knowledge, their lost kindness has been replaced with malice.  \n**Devour Breath.** A deathwisp feasts on the breath of living things, and invariably seeks to devour animals and solitary intelligent prey. It is quite intelligent and avoids fights against greater numbers.  \n**Undead Nature.** A deathwisp doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep",
