  "desc": "_This enormous pig is as large as an ox, and its mouth bristles with mismatched tusks. Its body is a lopsided mass of tumorous flesh that gives way to eyes and vestigial mouths, and long tentacles trail from its sides._  \nFrom time to time, a breach forms in the fabric of the multiverse, and the Material Plane is bathed in the energy of alien dimensions. Living creatures exposed to this incursion can undergo horrible mutations, turning into monstrous mockeries of their former shapes. One example of this phenomenon is the rift swine: once-ordinary pigs transformed into slavering horrors after being bathed in eldritch light.  \n**Destructive Herds.** Rift swine travel in herds of 5-8 (and larger herds are possible). Their effect on an area can be catastrophicâ€”they eat nearly anything, possess a fiendish cunning, and delight in the destruction they cause. A rift swine has difficulty perceiving anything smaller than itself as a threat, leading it to attack most other creatures on sight and fighting until it is destroyed.  \n**Abyssal Meat.** The rumors of vast herds of hundreds of rift swine on strongly chaos-aligned planes, cultivated by the lords of those places, are thankfully unconfirmed.",
