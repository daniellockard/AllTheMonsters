  "desc": "This blue-skinned corpse, covered in frosty patches with a ridge of icicles down its spine, lumbers forward._  \n**Eater of Frozen Corpses.** While most types of ghouls prefer freshly killed meat, winterghasts enjoy flesh afflicted with frostbite or gangrene. Since the opportunity for meals is diminished in less populated tundra, winterghasts are careful to avoid spawning additional winterghasts through the disease they inflict. This outlook also prevents winterghasts from gathering in large numbers, but they sometimes form clans for mutual protection and to keep other winterghasts from hunting in their territories. When times become lean, these clans often tear each other apart through infighting, and the survivors scatter to hunt in solitude.  \n**Scorned by Darakhul.** Even from their underground kingdoms, Open Game License",

The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The exhaustion and hp maximum reduction last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's hp maximum to 0, the creature dies, and it rises as a winterghast 1d4 hours later.
