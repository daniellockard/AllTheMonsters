On a failure, a creature takes 21 (6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls unconscious while poisoned in this way. The unconscious creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
