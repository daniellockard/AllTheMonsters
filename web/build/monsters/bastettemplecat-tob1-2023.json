While charmed by the temple cat, the target is incapacitated and must move on its turn toward the cat by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet of the cat and pet or hold it. The target doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the cat, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the temple cat's Fascinating Purr for the next 24 hours. The temple cat has advantage on attack rolls against any creature petting or holding it."

The spellcaster doesn't expend spell slots to imbue the cat in this way. The cat can be imbued with no more than three spells at a time. The cat can use the Spellcasting action to cast each spell once, requiring no material components. Once the spells are expended, the temple cat must finish a long rest before it can be imbued with spells again."
