  "desc": "_An eye golem is muscular giant, well-proportioned with smooth, marble-white skin covered in eye-like sigils. When it opens one of its eyes opens for a moment, a beam as bright as the sun shines forth, piercing the darkness._  \n**Covered in Arcana.** Eye golems stand at least ten feet tall, and their magically durable hide is covered with real eyes as well as arcane sigils that resemble eyes.  \n**Blinds Victims.** An eye golem rarely kills its victims, but leaves them blinded, wandering and tormented, seeing only visions of the eye golem flashing through their memory. This drives some mad while others instead choose to serve the golem, becoming devoted to the one who still holds sight.  \n**All Eyes Open.** When killed, an eye golem does not simply fall down dead. All of its eyes open at once, a deafening bellow is heard for miles, and a blinding burst of light shines from the body. When the light and noise stop, hundreds of perfectly preserved eyeballs are left on the ground, still warm and fresh and without scars or damage. Thin beams of arcane energy connecting the eyes to their owners can be detected with a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Those who wield the central eye once the golem is slain can use it to restore stolen eyes to their victims.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
