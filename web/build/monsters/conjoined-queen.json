  "desc": "The torso of a pale humanoid woman melds into the thorax of a massive insect. It moves about on six pointed legs, stabbing through stone and metal alike._  \n**Born in Chaos.** The first conjoined queen was created when cultists sacrificed a captured queen to their dark insectoid god. In a ritual of chaotic magic, the human queen and an insect queen were joined, forming a chitinous chrysalis from which the conjoined queen eventually emerged.  \n**Rulers of the Many-Legged.** A conjoined queen rules from a subterranean throne room, often in a burrow under the ruins of a fallen monarchyâ€™s castle. There she commands her insectoid host and sits atop a pile of incubating eggs.  \n**Hungry for Power.** The conjoined queen hungers for humanoid flesh but also for power. She seeks to rule and conquer humanoids and insects alike. Her armies consist of giant insects and the humanoids who ride them into battle.",
