  "desc": "_These patches of tangled, lacy moss cling to the ceiling, slowly pulsing with an eerie glow. Their stems gently writhe among the soft, feathery mass, dusting the ground below with a twinkling of phosphorescent spores._  \n**Plant Carnivore.** Cavelight moss glows with a pale yellow light, but when agitated, its light changes to an icy blue. Cavelight moss is frequently mistaken for a benign organism, but it hunts living flesh and renders its meals immobile before starting the long process of digestion.  \nA cavelight moss is a collective of smaller life forms patched together and sharing sensations. Barely cognitive, a cavelight moss spends its time positioning itself above well-traveled sections of cavern, feeding on rats, bats, and crawling insects. When it senses larger prey, it slowly and quietly moves toward the creature.  \n**Long-Lived Spores.** A cavelight moss can survive for 200 years, shedding luminous spores and consuming vermin. Its spores germinate in the carcasses of its victims, and in lean times, these spores can grow, albeit slowly, on guano or other areas rich in moisture and organic nutrients.  \n**Rare Colonies.** If a cave system has no true protectors and food is plentiful, these creatures congregateâ€”most commonly, in bat colonies of millions of individuals. When they gather this way, cavelight mosses function as a large colony, covering strategic locations where prey roams. When a source of food moves on, the entire colony slowly disperses as well.",
