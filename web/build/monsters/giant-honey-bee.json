  "desc": "Giant honey bees congregate in great swarms and fill hollows in rocky hillsides with their massive wax and honey hives. Far more intelligent than their diminutive cousins, giant honey bees sometimes enter into relationships with bearfolk or other creatures who can help protect the hive in exchange for a small share of the bees’ honey. Unlike a normal honey bee, a giant honey bee who stings a creature doesn’t lose its stinger.  \nGiant honey bees are rarely idle, often moving in elaborate, waggling dances of spirals and loops. This “dance” is actually a complex language the bees use to share staggeringly accurate directions and information about nearby threats and food sources with the rest of their hive.",
