  "desc": "A common threat in canals, lagoons, bayous, and countless other bodies of water, the giant water scorpion is responsible for the deaths of many adventurers exploring waterways. Like most aquatic monsters, giant water scorpions are seldom at the top of the food chain in their native environment, and black dragons in particular enjoy snacking on them. Swamp and water-dwelling humanoids like lizardfolk have been known to use the giant water scorpion’s carapace to create shields or coverings for their tents. The creature’s long tail acts as a breathing tube for it, which is often harvested and used by intrepid explorers and inventors in the creation of diving bells and other apparatuses for traversing the stygian depths.",
