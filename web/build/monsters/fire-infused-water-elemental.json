The elementals are irreparably changed and exist in a state between fire and water elemental. Too fiery for one and too watery for the other, they often find their way to the Material Plane, where they can carve out their own territory.  \n**Geothermal Dwellers.** Fire-infused water elementals prefer to inhabit areas with water heated by geothermal activity, such as hot springs and geysers. They claim such locations as their homes and grow violent when creatures harm or pollute their claimed waters. Fire-infused water elementals get along well with Open Game License",
