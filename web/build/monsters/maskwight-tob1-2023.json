A creature killed by this wail is erased from the memories of every creature in the planes that ever saw or interacted with it, all written or pictorial references to the target fade away, and its body is obliterated. Only divine beings and creatures that saw the creature die are unaffected by this memory erasure. The slain creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell."
