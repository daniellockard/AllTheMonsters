  "desc": "_This ancient animal-headed pillar is engraved with weathered symbols from ancient empires._  \n**Animal Headed.** Possessed pillars are carved from enormous blocks of stone to look like animal-headed gods of ancient pantheons, or sometimes demonic figures of zealous cults. The most common are the jackal-faced and the ibis-headed variants, but pillars with baboon, crocodile, elephant, or hawk heads also exist.  \n**Hijacked by Cults.** Some such pillars are claimed by various cults, and carved anew with blasphemous symbols or smeared with blood, oils, and unguents as sacrificial offerings.  \n**Weapon Donations.** Priests claim the weapons stolen by the pillars and distribute them to temple guards or sell them to fund temple activities.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A possessed pillar doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",

The saving throw uses the same ability as the attack used. The pillar can release all metal weapons stuck to it whenever it wants. A pillar always drops all weapons stuck to it when it believes it's no longer threatened. This ability affects armor only during a grapple."
