Its elemental will presses on those near as a near-physical pressure._  \n**Relics of Dark Gods.** Idolic deities are found in ancient temples and deserted tombs. They are relics of an elder age and all that remains of the favored children of deceiving dark god— mighty lordlings like Akoman the Evil Thought, Nanghant the Discontented, and Sarvar the Oppressor. Sent to consume the souls of those worshiping gods of light, these beings of shadow and sand labored slowly through corruption of the soul rather than outright war.  \n**Imprisoned Shadow Demons.** The corrupted ancient tribes and their priests began worshiping them as gods, and they forsook their master’s purpose to revel in their pride and vanity until they were struck down for their treachery. They have since wasted to a shadow remnant and been imprisoned in stony idols that barely cling to solidity.  \n**Constructed Nature.** An idolic deity doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
