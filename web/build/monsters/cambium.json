Its long, hollow, needle-like fingers and its many-jointed arms move with surprising speed and strength for such an emaciated creature._  \n**Hunched and Robed.** The cambium skulks through mortal society, hunched and contorted, concealing its nine-foot height and its supernumerary arms.  \n**Devours Bodily Humors.** The source of a cambium’s interest lies in every mortal body: the four humors, which it drains in precise amounts, sometimes to fix its own imbalances, sometimes to concoct serums meant for sale in hellish markets. Its victims are left in a desperate state, eager for a corrective fix and willing to obey the cambium’s every whim as servants and toadies.  \n**Abandons Victims.** After a sufficient crop has been harvested, the cambium abandons these addicts to die slowly from violent withdrawals, and allows the local population to lie fallow for a decade or so.",
