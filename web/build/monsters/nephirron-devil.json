It opens its mouth in a sardonic smile, and the head of a serpent appears between its lips, hissing with malevolent, mirthful relish._  \n**Devilish Infiltrators.** Nephirron devils are powerful fiends with draconic features that are adept at corrupting good-aligned dragons and bending evil dragons to their will. The older and more powerful the dragon, the bigger the challenge in the eyes of the nephirron devil. When two of these devils meet, they typically boast about the number and types of dragons they have manipulated and destroyed. This pride can also be a nephirron devilâ€™s undoing, however, for it often overlooks humanoids attempting to interfere with its plans, and more than one nephirron devil has been brought low by a band of mortal heroes.  \n**Hellish Nobles.** Nephirron devils are treated as lesser nobility in the hells, second only to pit fiends and arch-devils in the infernal pecking order.
