  "desc": "_The reeking pile of bodies and bones as large as a giant lurches forward. Corpses that tumble off it rise moments later as undead and follow the determined hill of corruption._  \n**Rise from Mass Graves.** In times of plague and war, hundreds of bodies are dumped into mass graves. Without sanctifying rites, necromantic magic can seep into the mound of bodies and animate them as a massive horror hungering for others to join its form.  \n**Absorb Bodies.** A corpse mound is driven to kill by the anger and loneliness of the dead within, and to absorb the bodies of its victims. It attacks any living creature larger than a dog, but it is drawn to humans and humanoids. It never tires no matter how many victims it accumulates. Entire towns have been wiped out by advancing corpse mounds.  \n**Undead Nature.** A corpse mound doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
