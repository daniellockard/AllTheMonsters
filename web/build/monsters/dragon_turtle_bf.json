Instead of dealing damage, the dragon turtle can choose to latch onto the target, if the target is a vehicle, such as a ship or wagon. If the vehicle is Huge or smaller, its speed is reduced to 0, and it can't be moved until the dragon turtle is killed or ends this effect. If the vehicle is Gargantuan, the vehicle's speed is halved, and the turtle moves with it when it moves. While latched onto a vehicle in this way, the turtle can make Bite attacks against only the vehicle and such attacks automatically hit. The turtle can end this effect at any time (no action required)."
