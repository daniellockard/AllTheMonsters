Its lips curl into a cruel smile as a cry of surprise and shouts of alarm resound in the dark cavern._  \nDeep beneath the earth, the derro gather in clans and worship beings that dwell between the stars. Lifelong exposure to these beings damages the psyche of the mortal derro, leaving most reliant on the powers of their dark masters.  \n**Assassins for Hire.** Derro outposts can be found in the slums of many surface cities.",
