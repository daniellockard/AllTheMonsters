  "desc": "A golden pair of glowing, avian irises reveal a large creature on a nearby tree. Horn-like feathered ears sit atop its muscular, winged form. As it shifts on its branch, its wings divulge a hint of insectoid claws beneath them. A soft, echoing voice asks, “Are you lost? Do you need aid?”_  \nSasori fukurōwashi are kami originating from reincarnated noble souls who consistently honored and protected nature in their past life.  \n**Friendly Protectors.** Unlike others of their kind, these kami are not found near specific shrines, and they can’t be summoned. The sasori fukurōwashi are divine spirits inherently connected to all of nature, fulfilling the role of divine agent, messenger, or roaming protector. They are generally peaceable, befriending non-evil humanoids, fey, and other magical beings that don’t defile natural environments.  \n**Nocturnal.** They are inclined to rest or meditate by day and are active from dusk until dawn. Blessed with the ability to shift to and from the Ethereal Plane, these kami have a distinct tactical advantage to aid any nearby kami or respectful and contrite travelers along their way.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.",
