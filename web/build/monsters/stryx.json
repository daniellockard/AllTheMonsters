  "desc": "_Stryx are the result of mad experiments deep within the plane of Shadows. They resemble owls and can pass as normal birds as long as they don’t speak or open their mouths. The stryx have a larger mouth hidden behind their beaks, filled with gleaming human teeth. Stryx range in color from pale gray to sooty black, with gleaming eyes._  \n**Strange Alchemy.** The stryx are unnatural beings that came about through terrible manipulation of normal owls and kidnapped humans.  \n**The Shadow’s Eyes.** Stryx thrive in the plane of Shadow and on the Material Plane equally, and they enjoy attaching themselves to powerful beings as spies, servants, and translators. Their purposes are muddied, however, because they constantly relay what they learn to their mad creator.",
