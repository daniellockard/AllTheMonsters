  "desc": "A tight, leather coif underneath a cracked, black mask that resembles a long-beaked bird with hollow, black eyes obscures the face and head of this humanoid. Long, tattered, dark-green robes drape loosely over its form. An obsidian censer decorated in etchings of dead trees moves from hand to hand, green mist pouring forth with each swing as it performs a strange and eerie dance._  \nPlague spirits and their deadly mists have haunted the planes as long as life has existed. The path of death left in their wake is often mistaken as the result of a natural disaster. Many druids speculate that plague spirits are entropic forces that exist as the embodiment of the darker side of nature, curbing overgrowth and allowing new life to grow from the dead.  \n**Harbingers of Decay.** The presence of a plague spirit is always announced by a rolling front of sickly, green mist that spans several miles. The spirit can always be found at the center, performing an unsettling yet enchanting dance. As it dances, the censer it carries expels mist in all directions. Any living thing exposed to this mist slowly succumbs to decay. Whether turning a lush forest and its inhabitants into a dark, desiccated landscape or creating a silent ruin out of a bustling city, the presence of a plague spirit forewarns a massive loss of life.  \n**Drawn to Life.** Plague spirits are drawn to the densest collections of life in an area, and nothing seems to deter these spirits from their path.",
