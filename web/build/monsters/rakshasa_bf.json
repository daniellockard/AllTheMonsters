The illusion ends if the rakshasa takes a bonus action to end it or if the rakshasa dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, a creature touching the disguised rakshasa might feel its fur instead of Humanoid flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 25 INT (Investigation) check to discern that the rakshasa is disguised."
