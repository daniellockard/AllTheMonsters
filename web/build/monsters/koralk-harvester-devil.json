  "desc": "_The fiendish hulk bears features taken from a nightmare scorpion, with three stinging tails and four limbs, and wields a massive scythe._  \n_**Transforming Poison.**_ Poison from any one of the koralk’s three stingers liquefies the target’s insides in an agonizing transformation. The stung creature swells as its organs, muscle, and skeleton rapidly break down and reform. When the skin casing pops, it releases a spray of gelatinous goo and reveals the form of a lemure, the lowest form of devil. The new lemure is subject to the will of more powerful devils, and its fate from that moment on is the same as any lemure’s. Eventually it will be remolded into a higher form of devil and become another warrior in service to the arch-devils. Astoundingly, the koralk’s poison can even work this transformation on demons, converting them to the lowest form of devil.  \n_**Infernal Mounts.**_ A koralk is large and strong enough for Medium-size devils to ride as a mount. They don’t like being used this way, but being devils, they do what they’re told by their betters or suffer the consequences.",
