  "desc": "_A hulking figure floats in the air, a winged horror painted in mist and moonlight._  \n**Corruptors of the Moon.** Always standing a bit apart from the machinations of the Dukes of Hell due to their dependence on moonlight, lunar devils can be found subverting druidical orders or leading packs of werewolves. They are a lazy breed of devil, and prefer lounging in the light of the moon over any more vigorous activity. The only exception is an opportunity to corrupt druids and moon-worshippers, pitting them against followers of sun gods.  \n**Vain and Boastful.** Lunar devils are as vain as they are indolent, and tales the fey tell of them involve thwarting them by appealing to their vanity. Lunar devils frequently befriend the dark fey.  \n**Flying in Darkness.** In combat, lunar devils sometimes cast fly on allies to bring them along, and they stay in areas of moonlight whenever they can. Lunar devils have excellent vision in total darkness as well, though, and are happy to use that against foes. At range, they use hurl moonlight and lightwalking to frustrate enemies. In melee, they use wall of ice to split foes, the better to battle just half at a time.",
