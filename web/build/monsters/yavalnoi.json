Each hostile creature within 30 feet of the yavalnoi must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be outlined in blue light for 1 minute. While outlined in blue light, a creature can't breathe underwater. This effect dispels spells such as water breathing and temporarily suppresses water breathing granted through magic items or a creature's natural physiology. In addition, the yavalnoi and creatures friendly to the yavalnoi have advantage on attack rolls against creatures outlined in blue light. A creature outlined in blue light can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
