  "desc": "_This lovely lass is clad in diaphanous veils and a revealing skirt, and she shows graceful skill while dancing through the dust._  \n**Humanoid Sand.** In its natural form, a mirager resembles a shifting mass of sand and dust with a vaguely humanoid shape, crumbling away like a sandcastle in the wind.  \n**Enticing Illusion.** A mirage can take on the guise of a lovely man or woman with luminous eyes, delicate features, and seductive garments. Whether male or female, a mirager dresses in veils and flowing robes that accentuate its enticing beauty.  \n**Thirst for Blood.** Whatever its apparent form, a mirager’s existence is one of unnatural and endless thirst. They hunger for flesh and thirst for blood, and they draw especial pleasure from leeching a creature’s fluids in the throes of passion. A victim is drained into a lifeless husk before the mirager feasts on the dehydrated remains.",

Those that fail are affected as by the enthrall spell with the mirager as the caster; they give the mirage their undivided attention, wanting only to explore it, marvel at its beauty, and rest there for an hour. The mirager can choose to have creatures focus their attention on it instead of the hallucinatory terrain. Creatures affected by the enthrall effect automatically fail saving throws to disbelieve the hallucinatory terrain. This effect ends if the hallucinatory terrain is dispelled."
