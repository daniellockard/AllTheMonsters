  "desc": "_The black carapace gleams in the desert sun, and its tail drips translucent venom. Even the largest lion avoids this scorpion._  \n**Highly Venomous.** Known for its small size and aggressive behavior, the Stygian fat-tailed scorpion brings a swift death to those who feel its toxic sting.  \n**Pit Traps.** A Stygian fat-tailed scorpion is no more than a foot long, with a tail about the same length. It weighs no more than 5 pounds for the largest specimensâ€”they make excellent guard animals that require little food or care, and are often kept at the bottom of pits or in rarely used tunnels.  \n**Valuable Venom.** A dose of fat-tailed scorpion venom can be worth 4,000 gp or more to the right buyer.",
