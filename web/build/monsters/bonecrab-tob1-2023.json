An infected creature develops the first symptoms after 24 hours. Symptoms include a mild chill that escalates to a fever and frightful hallucinations that give the disease its name. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. The exhaustion lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the disease recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the lesser restoration spell or similar magic."
