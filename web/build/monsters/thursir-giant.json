  "desc": "_Heavily armored and carrying two rune-marked hammers, a thursir giant’s reddish hair and beard are often plaited in the style of an enormous dwarf._  \n**Forge Masters.** Greedy and aggressively competitive, thursir dwell in vast caverns under frozen mountains where they labor to forge chains, armor, and massive engines of war. Thursir giants have a natural affinity for metalworking. Any armor or weapons forged by a thursir giant are of the highest quality and can fetch double the usual price for such an item.  \n**Enormous Appetites.** When not toiling at the forge, these giants entertain themselves with gluttonous feasts and boisterous wrestling competitions, or raid human settlements for food and valuables.  \n**Hearth Rune Priestesses.** Female priestesses have a much higher standing in their society than other female thursir giants, who are treated shabbily. Most female thursir giants are drudges, considered fit only for child-bearing and menial labor. However, male thursir are makers, warrior, and metalworkers, while women make up the bulk of their priesthood and spellcasters. As priests and casters, they are valued advisors and held in high regard—or at least very valuable property.  \nThursir stand nine feet tall and weigh 600 lb.",
