  "desc": "The foul abomination wriggles about on multiple caterpillar-like claspers. It has the jagged, circular maw and slippery body of an oversized leech and the head and coloration of a fierce tiger._  \n**Night Terrors.** Many sleepers have experienced nightmares in which a shadowy creature was sitting on them, draining them of their vital essence. While most of these experiences are because of some underlying psychological trauma, some are the result of visitations by terrifying creatures of the night. One such creature is the heggarna, a vile aberration that feeds on a creature’s mental energy as it sleeps and infuses the victim’s subconscious with terrible nightmares for its own vile amusement.  \n**Hidden Fear.** During the day, the heggarna disguises itself as a stray cat, lurking near the homes of potential prey and fleeing with feline-like caution when anyone comes near. Most humanoids overlook simple animals like cats when dealing with a heggarna infestation, but magic can detect the creature’s true appearance. Normal animals react to the heggarna with a strange ferocity, which experienced hunters recognize as a sign of a heggarna.",

The illusion ends immediately if the heggarna attacks or takes damage, but it doesn't end when the heggarna uses Dream Eating.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the heggarna could appear to have fur, but someone touching it would feel its slippery flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern the heggarna is disguised."

The target's Charisma score is then reduced by 1 for each hour the heggarna stays attached. The target dies if this reduces its Charisma to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest at least 24 hours after the heggarna reduced its Charisma.\n\nWhile attached, the heggarna fills the target's dreams with nightmares. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it doesn't gain any benefit from its current rest. If the target succeeds on the saving throw by 5 or more, it immediately awakens.\n\nThe heggarna can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. It does so after it reduces the target's Charisma by 8 or if the target dies."
