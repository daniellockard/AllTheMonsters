  "desc": "_A thick swirl of dust rises, settles, and forms the vague outline of a man—two points of yellow light shine where its eyes should be, staring malevolently._  \n**Mound Haunter.** A haugbui is an undead spirit tied to its burial mound or barrow. It serves as a familiar, protective spirit to nearby farmsteads or villages, so long as tribute is regularly paid to the haugbui. Traditional offerings may include pouring the first beer from a barrel, leaving portions of meals out overnight, sacrificing blood or livestock, or burying a portion of any income in the mound. A freshly-woken haugbui devours the remains of creatures it was buried with, such as a hawk, hound, or horse.  \n**Milder Spirits.** Haugbuis are related to vaettir, but much older. They are more humble and less prone to taking umbrage, and indeed, a great many haugbui have long since forgotten their own names. They are not quick to spill blood when irritated, and thus are viewed with greater tolerance by the living.  \n**Scrye and Watch.** They prefer to watch over their people from within their mound, and only come forth over the most grievous insults or injuries. They can do a great deal from within their mounds thanks to their scrying ability.  \n**Undead Nature.** A haugbui doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
