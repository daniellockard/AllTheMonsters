If the creature can't or won't let go of the weapon, it is also stuck to the pillar and restrained. A stuck weapon can't be used. A creature can take its action to remove one metal object from the pillar by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The pillar can release one creature or metal object stuck to it as a bonus action. If the pillar dies, all creatures and metal objects stuck to it are released."
