Then, the seed becomes a disease, devouring the creature from the inside as it grows vines throughout the creature's body. Until the disease is cured, the infected creature can't regain hp, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 (2d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if this disease reduces its hp maximum to 0."
