Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and at the start of each of the target's turns, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. The cavelight moss then gains 5 temporary hp. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw can't suffer further levels of exhaustion from the cavelight moss's grapple for the next 24 hours.
