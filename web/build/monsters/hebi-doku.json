  "desc": "A serpent rises in tight coils, until its head is level with that of a tall man. Its body is thick and covered in glossy black scales broken by wide bands of bright orange. The two smaller serpents growing from its torso wind together and hiss menacingly. Twin rattles shake rapidly behind the creature._  \n**Ophidian Masters.** Shrines to hebi-doku are found most often in places where venomous snakes are common. They are also located in regions where snakes are considered sacred and in the homes and guilds of assassins who favor the use of toxins. Hebi-doku are never found without an accompaniment of other serpents.  \n**Feared and Placated.** Adventurers and archaeologists who travel through snake-filled jungles and ruins offer hebi-doku tribute, hoping that doing so will purchase some protection from the snakes they encounter. Scorned lovers sometimes venerate a local hebi-doku in the hopes that it will poison future relationships for their former paramour. A hebi-doku claims to care little for the veneration of non-serpents, but it knows it will cease to exist without their gifts.  \n**Toxic Shrines.** To summon a hebi-doku, a heart stilled by snake venom must be laid at the foot of a low altar built of mongoose bones.  \n**Immortal Spirit Nature.** The kami doesnâ€™t require food, drink, or sleep.",
