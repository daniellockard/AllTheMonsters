  "desc": "_Stunningly tall and beautiful fiends, the heralds of darkness resemble dark-haired fey wearing cloaks and armor glittering with dark light and often surrounded by a nimbus of pale green fire._  \nHeralds of darkness speak in fluid tones and sing with the voices of angels, but their hearts are foul and treacherous.  \n**Vision of Evil.** Indeed, the heralds of darkness can take on another appearance entirely, disappearing into insubstantial shadows and unveiling an evil majestic form that leaves those who see it shaken and weakâ€”and often blind. Speaking of this form is difficult, but poets and bards trying to describe it have said it resembles an apocalyptic horror built of chained souls and the slow death of children carried along in a glacial river, rushing to an inevitable doom.  \n**Sword and Cloak.** The black sword and star-scattered cloak of a herald of darkness are part of its magical substance and cannot be parted from it. Some believe the cloak and blade are true visions of its body; the smiling face and pleasing form are entirely illusory.  \n**Corruptors of the Fey.** The heralds of darkness are companions and sometimes masters to the shadow fey. They seek to draw many others into their orbit with wild promises of great power, debauchery, and other delights. They are rivals to the heralds of blood and bitter foes to all angels of light.",
