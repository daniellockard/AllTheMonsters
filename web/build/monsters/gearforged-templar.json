  "desc": "_The bronze and mithral figure advances with heavy movements. Its eye lenses glare dark blue, and gears click when it swings its glaive._  \nAn intricate construction of bronze, steel, copper, and mithral, the gearforged templar is an imposing sight. A humanoid spirit contained in a soulgem animates the heavy body of gears and springs. Gearforged are relatively rare, and the champion is a paragon among them.  \n**Tireless Defender.** The gearforged templar is relentless in pursuit of its duty. More so then other gearforged, the champion’s mindset becomes fixed on its charge to the exclusion of distractions and even magical coercion. Gearforged templars serve as commanders of military or guard units, bodyguards for important individuals, or personal champions for nobility.  \n**Constructed Nature.** The gearforged templar doesn’t require food, drink, air, or sleep.",
