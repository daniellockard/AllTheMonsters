  "desc": "Esteron are small, winged salamanders that live in large groups. They cluster around subterranean bodies of water and aggressively protect such places. Some underground creatures see the esteron as a delicacy, but those who hunt esteron know the beasts are quick to form swarms that can easily overwhelm an unprepared hunter.  \nEsteron are highly sociable, communal creatures, and their communities are not lorded over by a dominant member. Instead, they cooperate with one another peacefully. When two groups of esteron encounter one another, they behave peacefully if the nearby water and food is abundant, sometimes even exchanging members. If resources are scarce, however, the group that inhabits the source of water drives away the outsider group with as little violence as possible.",
