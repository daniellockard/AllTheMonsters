  "desc": "A massive mammalian herbivore with a long neck and a thick, pebbled hide._  \n**Towering Megafauna.** Also called paraceratherium, mei jiao shou are the second largest land mammal after the only slightly larger oliphaunts. They stand around 20 feet tall, nearly 25 feet long and weigh a staggering 12 to 16 tons.  \n**Vast Herds.** The mei jiao shou are native to high grasslands and steppes, and wander the plains in groups of 20 to 50 beasts, grazing on the thick foliage. When together, they fear few predators. Even dragons take caution when hunting a herd of them and more often than not choose to seek easier prey.  \n**Docile Livestock.** Due to their docile nature, mei jiao shou are often kept as semi-wild livestock by giants and some humanoid tribes. Their self-sufficiency and resistance to predation make them great choices for those living in areas plagued by large predators.",
