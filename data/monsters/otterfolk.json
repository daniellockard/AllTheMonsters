  "desc": "Brown fur covers the entire surface of this humanoid, which also has the black nose and small ears of an otter. Its piecemeal leather armor and weapon at the ready give the impression it is prepared for a fight._  \n**Foe to Reptilians.** While generally peaceful creatures, otterfolk bear an enmity for reptilians, owing to their near extinction in the jaws of giant alligators and other large swamp predators. They are wary of intelligent reptilian creatures, such as lizardfolk and naga, who regularly prey on their people. Otterfolk pass this animosity on to future generations through tales of heroic otterfolk overcoming ferocious snakes and mighty alligators. From the time an otterfolk kit can walk, it learns how to wield the atlatl and to be mindful of the presence of their hated foes. Otterfolk are wary of reptilian visitors or those accompanied by reptiles, but they are cordial to all others.  \n**Swamp Guides.** Otterfolk are excellent sources of information about the territory surrounding their homes, and they often escort friendly visitors through the swamp. The price for this service depends on the combat capabilities of those they escort. Their overwhelming martial outlook causes them to value visitors who can prove themselves in combat. If a group seems capable of protecting itself, the otterfolk reason they donâ€™t have to defend the group in addition to guiding it. They often ask such groups for a pittance in rations or monetary value (preferring pearls to other valuable items). Otterfolk greatly increase their fees for groups apparently incapable of fighting off potential swamp hazards. However, they pride themselves on never abandoning their charges.  \n**Otter Trainers.** Otterfolk often raise river otters as guard animals and pets, which serve the same function in their society as dogs in human societies. Otterfolk regard the animals warmly and become sad when favored pets die. They rarely allow their otters to engage in combat. They regularly hold contests where otter owners show off their training prowess by directing their otters in feats of strength, cunning, and dexterity. These contests never involve pitting the otters against each other in combat. The rare few otterfolk who choose to become wizards take otters as familiars. Otterfolk rangers often raise larger river otter specimens (use the statistics of a Open Game License",
