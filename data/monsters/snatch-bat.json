Instead of dealing damage the snatch bat can steal one item the target is wearing or carrying provided the item weighs no more than 10 pounds isn't a weapon and isn't wrapped around or firmly attached to the target. Ex: snatch bat could steal a hat or belt pouch but not a creature's shirt or armor. Bat holds stolen item in its long neck-arm and must regurgitate that item (no action required) before it can make another Pilfering Bite."
