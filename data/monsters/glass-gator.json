  "desc": "_So called by some watermen because of its method of hunting, the glass gator is a nearly-transparent ambush hunter. It usually strikes from a bed of water, either stagnant or flowing. The transparency of the creature, combined with its jet of silt and poisonous sting, make it an effective hunter._  \n**Strange Anatomy.** The body of a glass gator is most similar to a centipede, but with four oversized forelimbs and a more distinct head. The forelimbs are used to attack, but they tire easily, forcing the glass gator to use its powerful lunge attack sparingly.  \nOnce the glass gator gets hold of prey, it wraps its body around the victim and squeezes, like a constrictor snake. Unlike a serpent, however, which uses powerful muscles to crush and suffocate its prey, the glass gator is only trying to bring its underbelly into contact with the prey. The glass gator’s belly is lined with hundreds of stingers that deliver a virulent nerve toxin.  \n**Transparency.** The glass gator’s transparency isn’t total. Its digestive tract usually is visible, especially for a few hours after it eats. The creature sometimes uses this limited visibility as bait, making itself appear as a wriggling snake or eel. It is most vulnerable just after eating, when it’s lethargic; if encountered in its lair shortly after a meal, the DM may give the glass gator disadvantage on initiative.  \n**Larval Form.** Subterranean variants—including some with bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It’s been postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.",
