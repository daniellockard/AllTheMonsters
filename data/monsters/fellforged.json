  "desc": "_A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton’s eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors._  \n**Wraith Constructs.** Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the construct bodies attract wraiths yearning to feel the corporeal world. The clockwork bodies trap the wraiths, which dulls many of their supernatural abilities but gives them physical form. The wraiths twist the bodies to their own use—going so far as to destroy the body to harm the living.  \n**Soldiers for Vampires.** Fellforged commonly seek out greater undead as their masters. Vampires and liches are favorite leaders, but banshees and darakhul also make suitable commanders.  \n**Grave Speech.** The voice of the fellforged is echoing and sepulchral, a tomb voice that frightens animals and children.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A fellforged doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
