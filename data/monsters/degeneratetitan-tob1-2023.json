On a failure, a creature takes 35 (10d6) force damage and is flung 20 feet away from the titan and knocked prone, as the earth buckles and tosses the creature. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't flung or knocked prone. If a flung creature strikes a solid surface, the creature takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was flung. If the creature is flung at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone."
