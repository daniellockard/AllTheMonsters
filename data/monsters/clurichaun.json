He has a bushy beard and wears a rumpled, red overcoat over a dirty white shirt and kneelength red trousers with blue stockings and silver-buckled shoes. A cap made from leaves stitched together with gold thread slouches atop his head, and he reeks of stale beer and wine._  \n**Drunks in the Cellar.** Clurichauns are mean-spirited, alcohol-loving fey that plague butteries and wine cellars. These drunken fey were once leprechauns, but they long ago forsook a life of toil for one of solitary debauchery. Now they spend every night drinking, warbling off-key, and tormenting their hapless hosts with cruel pranks.  \nHowever, if the clurichaun’s host keeps him or her well supplied with a favorite libation and otherwise leaves him or her alone, the clurichaun will protect their wine cellars from thieves, drunkards, or worse—becoming quite vigorous when they feel the security of the cellars is threatened in any way. They have a particular hatred for Open Game License",
