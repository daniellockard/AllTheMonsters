  "desc": "The muscled reptilian swings its mighty axe at angels and fiends alike on the front lines of a reptilian army._  \nThe largest and strongest of the satarre, destroyers hold the shield wall and strike down their enemies throughout the planes. These hulking specimens wear banded or scaled armor, often with a glistening varnish finish. Their most common weapons include spears, heavy polearms, and axes.  \n**Shield Wall.** Large squads and companies of satarre destroyers often use void magic to create crackling, violet shield walls. When they do, the destroyers stand shoulder to shoulder, their shields overlapping, and prevent enemies from advancing past them to the mystics they protect.  \n**Necrotic Lore.** Satarre destroyers are well-versed in necromantic magic and other arcana, although they do not perform it themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command undead minions using Void Speech.",
