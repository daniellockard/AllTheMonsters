  "desc": "The tosculi are a race of wasp-folk that share the Golden Song of the hive, which unites them under the command and iron rule of their queen. Each hive has its own song, and most tosculi hives are predatory, dangerous places—quick to turn to banditry, cattle theft, and raiding against small villages.  \nThose few tosculi who do not hear their queen’s Golden Song are the Hiveless, driven out of the embrace of the hive to attempt survive on their own.  \nTosculi drones are the workers of the tosculi hive; the smallest, weakest, least intelligent, and most abundant of the wasp folk. Their carapaces are mostly iridescent blue with gold abdomens and lower legs. A drone stands between 3 and 4 feet tall, and weighs around 50 lb. They have only vestigial wings, so they can glide but not truly fly.  \n**One-Way Scouts.** Drones function primarily as menial workers but, during time of war, they also act as highly expendable scouts and soldiers. Because the warriors know whatever a drone knows (thanks to the hive-queen), a drone doesn’t need to survive its scouting mission to deliver useful information.",
