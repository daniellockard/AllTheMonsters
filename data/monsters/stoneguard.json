  "desc": "The elemental wardens of earth are a stoic people, slow to change socially, and more likely to fight defensive battles and outlast enemies than wage offensive wars. The stoneguard are the perfect embodiment of this ideal; their druidic training has been augmented by ancient combat techniques, allowing them to hold fast against a tide of enemies. They craft arms and armor from the granite around them, and their magical stonecraft rivals that of the dwarves.",
