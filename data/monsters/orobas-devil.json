  "desc": "_Tall and powerful, this creature resembles a strong man with well‑chiseled muscles, save its equine head, flaring nostrils, and hoofed feet._  \nThe orobas thrive in Hell, selling their knowledge to those who have the coin (or other form of payment). The common phrase, “never trust a gift horse,” stems from these corrupting devils.  \n**Horse-Headed but Wise.** When called to the mortal world, they sometimes take the shape of a destrier. Orobas devils prefer to take the horrific form of a horse-headed man. Sulfuric smoke curls from their nostrils and their fingers sport ragged claws. This beast‑like appearance belies their true strength; the orobas possess an uncanny knowledge of the past, as well as of things to come.  \n**Masters of Deceit.** When bargaining with an orobas, one must speak truthfully—or possess an exceptionally quick tongue and the most charming smile. Practitioners of the dark arts know these devils as the Lords of Distortion, for their ability to practice deceit. They prize reality-warping magic above all else, and bribes of that sort can win concessions when making a pact.  \n**Surrounded by Lessers.** Orobas devils gather lesser devils both as chattel and defense. Their analytical minds telepathically confer the strengths and weaknesses of foes to their allies. With surprising speed, the deceivers can assess a battlefield, weigh outcomes, and redirect forces. Enemies of the orobas almost never catch them off guard. They have frequent, clear visions of their immediate future.",
