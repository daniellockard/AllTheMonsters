On a failure  the creature is confused for 1 minute. It repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns  ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature makes its saving throw or the condition ends for it  it is immune to the chaos pheromones of khalkos spawn for the next 24 hours."
