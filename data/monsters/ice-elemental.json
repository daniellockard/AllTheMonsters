Ice elementals emerge from the core of ancient glaciers or rise from foot-thick patches of permafrost. They are aware of portals to their demiplane, but they often choose to traverse terrestrial lands as long as the temperatures remain below freezing. Though not inherently malevolent, they enjoy enclosing warmblooded foes in ice and watching as the creatures freeze. Some ice elementals even decorate their lairs with these “sculptures.”  \n**Rivals to Water Elementals.** Open Game License",
