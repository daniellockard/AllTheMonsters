  "desc": "_This furred humanoid glides silently through the canopy of trees, gripping a blowgun. It observes visitors cautiously with two intelligent, bulbous eyes._  \n**Jungle Rulers.** These small, intelligent, squirrel-like humanoids live in reclusive, primitive societies deep in the jungle. They are omnivorous, subsisting on fruits and roots, insects and larvae, bird and snake eggs, and birds and small mammals. They sometimes barter with more advanced creatures for metal and crafted items.  \n**Nocturnal Gliders.** Lemurfolk are nocturnal, though they can adopt daytime hours when they must. They prefer to hunt and move by gliding between trees, catching prey off guard.  \n**Greyfur Elders.** Greyfurs are the eldest and most revered kaguani, as much as 80 years old; their age can be estimated by the graying of their fur, but they don’t track the years. Greyfurs are cunning individuals and command the arcane arts, though they rarely pursue the art of necromancy—a strong taboo prohibits them from interacting with the dead.  \nA typical lemurfolk stands 2 feet tall and weighs 30 lb.",
