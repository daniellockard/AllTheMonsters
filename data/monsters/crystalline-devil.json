Their feet, however, are soft and bare, allowing them to pad along with surprising stealth, always looking for a favorable spot to assume gem form  \n**Winking Jewels.** In its treasure form, a crystalline devil resembles a pretty, sparkling jewel lying on the ground, glowing with a warm inner light. They seek to catch the eye of an unwary creature whose mind it might corrupt to greed and murder. If their identity is discovered in gem form, they reassume their normal form and attack.  \n**Passed Along.** After insinuating themselves into groups, they encourage betrayal and murder, then persuade a host to pass on their treasure as atonement for their crimes.",
