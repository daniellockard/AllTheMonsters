If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers one level of exhaustion and doesn't regain expended Hit Dice from the rest. On a success, the creature's exhaustion level decreases by one, and it regains expended Hit Dice as normal from the rest. If a successful saving throw reduces the diseased creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease, ending it."
