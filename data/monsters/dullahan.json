Its rider, swathed in black leather, raises his arm to reveal not a lantern but its own severed, grinning head._  \nThough it appears to be a headless rider astride a black horse, the dullahan is a single creature. The fey spirit takes the shape of the rider holding its own head aloft like a lantern, or (more rarely) the form of an ogre cradling its head in one arm.  \n**Harbingers of Death.** Hailing from the darkest of fey courts, the dullahan are macabre creatures that walk hand in hand with death. They sometimes serve powerful fey lords and ladies, riding far and wide in the capacity of a herald, bard, or ambassador. More often than not they carry doom to a wretch who roused their lord’s ire.  \n**Relentless Nature.** The dullahan doesn’t require food, drink, or sleep.",
