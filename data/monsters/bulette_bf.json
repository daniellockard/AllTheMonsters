It occupies a space of its choice within 5 feet of that point, and each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 15 STR save. On a failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone. Any creature in the bulette's space is then pushed into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the bulette. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the bulette's space."

On a failure, the target is frightened until the end of its next turn, and the bulette has advantage on the next attack roll it makes against the creature before the start of its next turn."
