  "desc": "_Dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden threads, this resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes billows under the hood._  \n**Silent Motion.** A billowing empty cloak glides through the air, either under its own power or on the shoulders of its master. Its movement appears odd somehow, as though it moves slightly out of step with the frame bearing it.  \n**Guards.** Created by the shadow fey as unobtrusive guardians, empty cloaks are often paired with animated armor such as a monolith footman, and made to look like a display piece.  \n**Shadow Servants.** Shadow fey nobles sometimes wear an empty cloak as their own clothing; they use it to cover a hasty retreat or to assist in a kidnapping.  \n**Constructed Nature.** An empty cloak doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
