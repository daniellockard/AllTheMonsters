The target repeats the saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure (to a minimum of 1 hit point) and becoming cured on a success.

If a swallowed creature deals 15 or more damage to the otyugh in a single turn, or if the otyugh dies, the otyugh vomits up the creature."
