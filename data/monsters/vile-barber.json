  "desc": "_A pale, scrawny fellow clad in a black leather apron and slender ebon gloves grins from the shadows. A maw of needle-sharp teeth and the wicked straight razor at his side are a clear warning that his enemies should hasten their footsteps._  \nVile barbers are sadistic, unseelie fey who move through the shadows to execute their bloody, malevolent wills. Known as barbers for both the use of wicked blades and their proclivity for slashing the necks of their victims, these insidious fey can be found lurking in dark and harrowed places like back-alley streets or abandoned, deep-shaded cemeteries.  \n_**Fey Punishers.**_ Called the siabhra (pronounced she-uvh-ra) among the fey courts, vile barbers are fickle creatures. They are sent to punish those who have offended the fey lords and ladies, and their cruelty and cunning help them write messages in blood and skin. At the very least, they scar those who have spoken ill of the fey; those who have harmed or murdered the fey are more likely to be bled slowly. Some of these deaths are made quite public—though in a few cases, the victim is enchanted to remain invisible while the siabhra does its bloody work.  \n_**Slippery Fighters.**_ A vile barber often uses its ability to step through shadows to steal a victim’s weapon and use it against its former owner with devastating effect. Any creature grappled by a vile barber is at the mercy of the barber’s sinister and unclean weapons—they delight in close combat.  \n_**Assassins and Envoys.**_ Vile barbers frequently consort with hags and prowl the places these wicked crones cannot go as emissaries and assassins. Information on the siabhra is scant; most adventurers who meet them don’t live to share their findings or to see the vile barber lick its bloody blade clean.",
