  "desc": "_A large reptile with a dagger-like teeth and a scaly hide of shifting colors, the gbahali often strikes from close range._  \n_**Chameleon Crocodiles.**_ While distantly related to crocodiles, gbahali have adapted to life away from the water. To make up for the lack of cover, gbahali developed chameleon powers. Gbahali hide changes color to match its surroundings so perfectly that it becomes nearly invisible. Any lonely rock on the grassland might be a gbahali waiting along a trail, caravan route, or watering hole. Their thick hide can be made into hide or leather armor, and with the proper alchemical techniques it retains some of its color-shifting properties.  \n_**Strong Hunters.**_ Gbahalis are powerful predators, challenged only by rivals too large for a gbahali to grapple or by predators that hunt in packs and prides, such as lions and gnolls. Gbahalis live solitary lives except during the fall, when males seek out females in their territory. Females lay eggs in the spring and guard the nest until the eggs hatch, but the young gbahali are abandoned to their own devices. Killing an adult gbahali is a sign of bravery and skill for plains hunters.  \n_**Sentries and Stragglers.**_ In combat, a gbahali relies on its chameleon power to ambush prey. It may wait quietly for hours, but its speed and stealth mean it strikes quickly, especially against weak or solitary prey. Its onslaught is strong enough to scatter a herd and leave behind the slowest for the gbahali to bring down.",
