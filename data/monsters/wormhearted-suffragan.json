  "desc": "_This humanoid wears robes to hide its corpselike pallor and lifeless gray hair. Fine, arm-length worms wriggle through abscesses in its flesh and its empty eye-sockets. It moves stooped over, with a shuffling gait, belying its speed and agility._  \n**Dark Worm Hearts.** Formerly, the suffragans were priests or holy officers of other faiths, but their hearts were corrupted by their fear and loathing. Once pledged to the service of a demon lord, it replaced their hearts with a bulbous, writhing conglomeration of worms, which permits them to carry on with an undead mockery of life.  \n**Prey on the Wounded.** They frequent graveyards, casting detect evil or speak with dead to learn who was truly cruel and duplicitous in life. They also follow armies, visiting battlefields shortly after the fighting is over. In the guise of nurses or chirurgeons, they select their targets from among the dead and dying for as long as they remain undetected. In both cases, they cast animate dead to provide the worm goddess with viable skeletal or zombie servants.  \n**Fear Light and Radiance.** Wormhearted suffragans have a weakness; they are especially susceptible to the flesh-searing power of radiant magic, and for this reason avoid priests of the sun god or gods of light. At night, however, they are a walking contagion, infesting their enemies with parasitic worms that devour victims from within. Their favorite tactic is to cast hold person, attack with a helminth infestation, then animate their slain enemies into unlife.  \n**Undead Nature.** A wormhearted suffragan doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
