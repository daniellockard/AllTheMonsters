  "desc": "A slender, humanoid-shaped plant dances in a clearing. Its two long legs and four arms are decorated with a plethora of vibrant petals and serrated leaves. A wide flower blossoms at the top of the whimsical performer._  \n**Jovial Creations.** Dancing foliage appears in areas where the magic of the arts combines with the magic of nature. Birthed by such magic, the creature is influenced by both: it loves the arts and is protective of the natural world.  \n**Garden Guardians.** Dancing foliage primarily inhabits and defends forest groves from outside threats, but they sometimes wander the gardens of urban settlements. Their love of flowers causes them to tend and protect the plants at all costs, often to the dismay of the gardenâ€™s owner or castle groundskeeper. Once a dancing foliage has decided to protect an area, it refuses to leave, though terms of pruning and planting can be negotiated with it, especially if such actions make the garden more aesthetically pleasing.  \n**Dancing Gardeners.** When tending to its garden, dancing foliage moves to some unheard tune, gracefully leaping, twirling, and bobbing around the garden. If it or its garden is threatened, the dancing foliage enters a battle dance until the threat is either removed or eliminated. It never pursues foes beyond the end of its garden.",

The dancing foliage whirls a flurry of serrated leaves around itself. Each creature within 10 feet of the dancing foliage must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) slashing damage on failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one."
