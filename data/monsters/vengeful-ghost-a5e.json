It can't use limited-used abilities or class traits that require spending a resource.

Additionally  the possessed creature repeats its saving throw whenever it takes damage. When the possession ends  the ghost reappears in a space within 5 feet of the body. A creature is immune to this ghosts Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on its saving throw or after the possession ends."
