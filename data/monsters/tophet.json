  "slug": "tophet",
  "desc": "_An enormous bronze and iron statue filled with fire towers above the ring of chanting, frenzied worshipers._  \nTophets are used by worshipers of fire gods, who toss sacrifices into their flaming maws to incinerate them. A tophet has a large opening in the front where the flames can be seen; sometimes this is an enormous mouth, and at other times it is a large hole in the tophet’s belly. Horns and expressions of anger or wide‑mouthed laughter are common.  \n**Eager for Sacrifices.** Among fire cultists, it’s widely known that when a tophet’s hands are raised above its mouth, it is demanding a sacrifice to roll down its palms and into its fiery maw.  \n**Heed Musical Commands.** Flutes and drums can (sometimes) be used to control the actions of a tophet during sacrifices. They have the fortunate side effect of drowning out the cries and screams of living sacrifices.  \n**Magical Fires.** The fires within a tophet’s bronze body are largely magical and fueled by sacrifices. They don’t require more than a symbolic amount of wood or coal to keep burning, but they do require sacrifices of food, cloth, and (eventually) living creatures to keep them under control. A tophet that is not granted a sacrifice when it demands one might go on a fiery rampage, burning down buildings, granaries, or barns until its hunger is satisfied.  \n**Constructed Nature.** A tophet doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
