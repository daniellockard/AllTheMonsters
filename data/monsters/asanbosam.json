  "desc": "_An asasonbosam is a hirsute hulk with bulging, bloodshot eyes, often perched high in a tree and ready to seize unwary passersby with talons like rusty hooks._  \n**Iron Hooks and Fangs.** They resemble hairy ogres from the waist up, but with muscular and flexible legs much longer than those of an ogre. These odd appendages end in feet with hooklike talons, and both the creature’s hooks and its fangs are composed of iron rather than bone or other organic material. These iron fangs and claws mark an asanbosam’s age, not just by their size but also by their color. The youngest specimens have shiny gray hooks and fangs, while older ones have discolored and rusty ones.  \n**Iron Eaters.** The asanbosam diet includes iron in red meat, poultry, fish, and leaf vegetables, and—in times of desperation— grinding iron filings off their own hooks to slake their cravings. The asanbosams’ taste for fresh blood and humanoid flesh led to the folklore that they are vampiric (not true).  \n**Tree Lairs.** Asanbosams spend most of their lives in trees, where they build nestlike houses or platforms of rope and rough planks. They don’t fear magic; most tribes count at least one spellcaster among its members.",
