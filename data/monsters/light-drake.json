It has glowing yellow eyes, and light reflects easily off its golden scales._  \n**Light Bringers.** Light drakes are obsessed with bringing light into dark places, and often inhabit the darkest parts of the world. They use their light to aid lost travelers and defeat the denizens of the darkest parts of the world. They are regularly hunted by such denizens, who offer large rewards for their golden hides.  \n**Social Trinket-Collectors.** Light drakes are social creatures that live in small, glowing colonies in deep caverns. Like their larger cousins, they enjoy collecting trinkets, though they prefer objects made of bright metals or iridescent stones. They often adorn themselves with such trinkets and use their light magic to make the trinkets shine. Light drakes tend to sleep together in piles for warmth and light in the cold darkness, which has led to many a thief inadvertently stumbling into a colony of the jewelry-coated sleeping drakes after mistaking them for a pile of glittering treasure.  \n**Undead Slayers.** Light drakes despise undead and any creatures that use light, or the absence of light, to prey on innocents. They have a particularly strong hatred for Open Game License",
