A fang charm dangling from its neck, the kobold goes about its business of secrets and whispers._  \n**Agents of the Empire.** Kobold spellclerks work primarily as messengers and agents of the spy network. They are skilled in code writing and breaking, overseeing the operations of other field agents, and providing their overlords a valued glimpse into the internal affairs of their enemies.  \n**Trusted Messengers.** Kobold spellclerks are often granted the use of magic items that aid in encryption and message-sending to supplement their natural skills and magical studies. The messages they carry or compose are often of great import to clandestine activities.",
