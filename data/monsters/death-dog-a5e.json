While diseased  the target makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every 24 hours  reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure and ending the disease on a success. This hit point maximum reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0."
