For 1 minute, the behtu has advantage on saving throws and ability checks that use Strength and Constitution, and its walking and climbing speeds are doubled.

A non-behtu that ingests the infusion must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (3d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't poisoned. The behtu typically has 1d4 + 1 infusions in its possession."
