The implanted egg rests in the creature's eye socket for 14 days while it incubates. A host creature can carry only one horakh egg to term at a time. While the egg is implanted, the host can't use its eye and has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. Exactly 24 hours before the egg hatches, the host becomes blinded. When the egg hatches, the young horakh erupts from the host's head, killing the host in the process."
