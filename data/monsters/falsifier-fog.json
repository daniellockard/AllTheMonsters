  "desc": "Falsifier fogs are foul urban mists that seek to distort the memory and manipulate the reality of victims using illusion and enchantment._  \n**Delusory Misery.** Falsifier fogs feed on the continued anxiety and depression they foment in populated towns and cities, using their unique abilities to infect large groups at a time. They do not look to kill victims, instead hoping to feed on distress for as long as possible.  \n**Relishing Manipulators.** Falsifier fogs are the souls of abusers and cult leaders who died collaborating with or benefitting from the manipulations of dark forces. Sometimes falsifier fogs form mutually beneficial relationships, willingly cooperating with evil spellcasters to spread misery. Open Game License",
