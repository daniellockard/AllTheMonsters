  "desc": "_Chattering creatures with a superficial similarity to squirrels, the ratatosk have tiny tusks and fur that shimmers in a way that defies the surrounding light._  \n**Sleek-furred Celestials.** The ratatosk is a celestial being that is very much convinced of its own indispensable place in the multiverse. Its fur is sleek, and it takes great pride in the cleaning and maintaining of its tusks.  \n**Planar Messengers.** Ratatosks were created to carry messages across the planes, bearing word between gods and their servants. Somewhere across the vast march of ages, their nature twisted away from that purpose. Much speculation as to the exact cause of this change continues to occupy sages.  \n**Maddening Gossips.** Ratatosk are insatiable tricksters. Their constant chatter is not the mere nattering of their animal counterparts, it is a never-ending celestial gossip network. Ratatosk delight in learning secrets, and spreading those secrets in mischievous ways. Itâ€™s common for two listeners to hear vastly different words when a ratatosk speaks, and for that misunderstanding to lead to blows.",
