If the target is a prone creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, the hagfish can burrow into the creature's flesh. While burrowed into a creature, the hagfish can't attack, and at the start of each of the hagfish's turns, the target loses 3 (1d4+1) HP as the hagfish consumes it from the inside. The burrowed hagfish moves with the target whenever the target moves, requiring none of the hagfish's movement. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement on its turn. It does so after it consumes 6 HP worth of flesh from the target or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can take its action to extract the burrowed hagfish by succeeding on a DC 11 WIS (Medicine) check."
