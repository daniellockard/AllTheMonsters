  "desc": "_A barefoot woman with long hair and almost transparent skin sits upon a willow branch. Her hair and clothing are wet, as if she has just returned from a swim. Her smile seems friendly enough._  \nWhen a woman drowns, her dripping body may rise again as a rusalka. Some claim the drowning must be a suicide. Others say that the water itself must be tainted with murder or some great evil spirit.  \n**Near Water.** Rusalkas dwell in the water where they died, emerging only at night. Some climb a nearby tree, dangle their feet in the water, and sing alluring songs. Others sit on the bank, combing their wet tresses and awaiting prey. They must, however, remain in or near the water where they died, as part of their curse. However, during a full moon, the rusalki can leave the water to dance along the shore or the riverbank, singing all night long and inviting young men to join them.  \n**Songs and Poetry.** Rusalkas mesmerize and seduce passersby with song and dance and poetry. Young men are their usual victims, but they also prey on curious children, lonely older men, and other heartbroken women. When a potential victim comes near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and drags him or her beneath the water to drown.  \n**Lover’s Walks.** A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim toward the center with the promise of a kiss—delivered as her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him. Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss (to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell over deep water and drag him to the bottom.  \n**Undead Nature.** A rusalka doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
