  "desc": "_This grizzled, weather-beaten creature looks like a sour old man at first glance, complete with scraggly beard. It carries a great pike and wears heavy boots, shod with iron, and the blood-soaked hat jammed on its head is hard to miss. It grins with massive yellow teeth._  \n**Blood-Soaked Caps.** Redcaps are exceedingly dangerous creatures who wear the mark of their cruelty and evil quite literally. The caps from which they take their name define their existence, and they must constantly be revived with fresh blood.  \n**Compelled to Kill.** Redcaps arenâ€™t cruel and murderous by choice, but by necessity. A redcap must frequently bathe its cap in fresh, humanoid blood to sustain itself. If it fails to do so every three days, the creature withers and dies quickly. A redcap whose hat is nearly dry is a desperate, violent force of nature that prefers to die in battle rather than waste away to nothing.  \n**Bandits and Mercenaries.** Most long-lived redcaps are drawn to serve in marauding armies or make a living through constant banditry.",
