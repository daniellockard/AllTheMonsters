  "desc": "_This headless giant has a large mouth in its chest, with eyes bulging out on either side of it._  \n**Always Hungry.** Blemmyes are brutes that savor humanoid flesh, and they see all humanoids as potential meals. Some even have the patience to tend groups of humans, goblins, or halflings like unruly herds, farming them for food and fattening them up for maximum succulence.  \n**Cannibals.** So great is their hideous hunger that blemmyes are not above eating their own kind; they cull and consume the weakest specimens of their race when other food is scarce. The most terrible habit of these monsters is that they seldom wait for their food to die, or even for a battle to conclude, before launching into a grisly feast.",
