As each drop hits the ground, it splatters into little red spores._  \nThe crimson shambler is an intermediary form of a hazardous slime mold found in deep caverns. It wanders the dark passageways, attacking any creatures it encounters to infect them with its spores.  \n**Gruesome Appearance.** The crimson shambler is a mobile plant, feeding off the remains of an infected creature. The overlay of red slime atop an ambulatory decomposing corpse is often mistaken as some type of undead creature. In actuality, the remains are animated by a slime mold, allowing it to hunt and infect other creatures until it finds a suitable place to spawn. Then it falls and becomes a new colony of crimson slime.",

The diseased creature's lungs fill with the spores, which kill the creature in a number of days equal to 1d10 + the creature's Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. One hour after infection, the creature becomes poisoned for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it rises as a crimson shambler, roaming for 1 week and attempting to infect any other creatures it encounters. At the end of the week, it collapses, its body fertilizing a new patch of crimson slime. A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the spores of all crimson shamblers and crimson slime for the next 24 hours."
