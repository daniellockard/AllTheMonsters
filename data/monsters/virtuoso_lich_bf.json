The muse can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The lich can have only one muse at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous muse ends. If the lich is within 30 feet of its muse and can see its muse, the lich has advantage on its first Artistic Flourish attack each round against a creature that isn't its muse."

On a failure, a creature is blinded, charmed, or deafened (the lich's choice) until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't incapacitated.\n- **Undead.** The target regains 18 (4d8) HP. Healing that exceeds the target's HP maximum becomes temporary HP."
