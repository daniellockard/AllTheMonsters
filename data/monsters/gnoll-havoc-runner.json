  "desc": "_The runner is a mottled blur, a sprinting gnoll laughing as it runs, ax held high. It sprints past, its weapon flashing in the sun._  \nWith the bristly mane and spotted fur characteristic of all gnolls, havoc runners blend into their tribe. Only the canny glint in the eyes hints at the deadly difference before the havoc runner explodes into violence.  \n_**Blinding Raids.**_ Havoc runners are scouring storms across the trade routes that crisscross the tribeâ€™s territory. Like all gnolls, they are deadly in battle. Havoc runners incorporate another quality that makes them the envy of many raiders: they can tell at a glance which pieces of loot from a laden camel or wagon are the most valuable, without spending time rummaging, weighing, or evaluating. Their ability to strike into a caravan, seize the best items, and withdraw quickly is unparalleled.",
