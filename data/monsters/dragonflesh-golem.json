  "desc": "A hulking being with a dragon’s head and a patchwork of black, blue, green, red, and white scales for skin lurches forward on two legs, raising clawed fists into the air._  \nDragonflesh golems are rare constructs created from the remains of dead chromatic dragons.  \n**Built from Dragon Corpses.** Dragonflesh golems are powerful, but building such a creature requires great expense beyond the normal costs to create most other golems. The crafter must use the remains of five dragons, one of each color, of adult age or older. Mages looking to construct dragonflesh golems often hire adventurers to acquire the bodies they need.  \n**Powered by Dragon Blood.** Dragonflesh golems require frequent infusions of dragon blood to remain operational. This blood does not need to come from a true dragon; any creature with draconic blood will suffice.  \n**Construct Nature.** The dragonflesh golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
