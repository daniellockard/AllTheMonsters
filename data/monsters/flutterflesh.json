  "desc": "_This mass of fused corpses resembles a butterfly with wings of skin, limbs of bone, and a head formed of several different skulls. The dark magic that formed this abomination swirls around it hungrily._  \n**Bound by Necromancy.** Flutterflesh result from a terrible necromantic ritual. Cultists gather in the name of a dark god, powerful lich, or crazed madman, and forever bind themselves body and soul into a single evil being. Flutterflesh take recently severed limbs and fuse these new pieces to themselves in accordance with some unknowable aesthetic.  \n**Dilemma of Flesh.** The most horrifying thing about a flutterflesh, however, is its devious nature. A flutterflesh offers its prey the choice to either die or lose a limb. One can always tell where a flutterflesh resides because so many of the locals are missing appendages.  \n**Undead Nature.** A flutterflesh doesnâ€™t require air, food, drink, or sleep.",
