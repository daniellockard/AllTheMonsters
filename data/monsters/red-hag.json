  "desc": "_An elder race—much older than the elves, and as old as the dragons, they claim—red hags are the most cunning and longest-lived of the hags, having a lifespan of more than a thousand years._  \n**Beautiful and Strong.** Unlike their hag kin, red hags are not horrid to look upon, and most are considered comely in their own right. Few know anything about them, and the hags do little to enlighten them, preferring their seclusion.  \n**Tied to Nature.** The hags have a deep connection with all elements of nature, and they often make their homes in deep forests, in caves, or alongside coastlines.  \n**Blood Magic.** Because of their close connection to nature, red hags often serve as druids. Within their druidic circles, however, they practice blood sacrifices and perform ritualistic blood magic—both to slake their craving for humanoid blood, but also as a means to venerate Hecate, goddesses of dark magic. Red hags also favor the cleric and wizard classes; few ever seek a martial path. The ancient hags all answer to a hierarchy.",
