When commanded to do so by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell, using the appropriate action required by the spell, with any parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously stored spell is lost."
